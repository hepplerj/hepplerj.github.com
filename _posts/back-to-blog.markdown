I'm considering going back to a blog format rather than launch page format for the site.  I'll be toying around with this minimalist theme (<a href="http://shaheeilyas.com/barecity/">barecity</a>) for a while and see if I like it.  Watch for the pages to return soon once I reformat them to fit the new theme.

The redesign is also meant as a rebooting of two things: 1) a new scholarly interest that is taking me in new directions for my dissertation (look for a blog post on this soon), and 2) a re-commitment to blogging regularly.  I'm starting small: one new thoughtful post per month, perhaps sprinkled with a few random posts from time to time.

I should also note I've been inspired by <a href="http://lenz.unl.edu/wordpress/">Steve Ramsay's theme</a>, hence the new look here. I do love minimalism.
