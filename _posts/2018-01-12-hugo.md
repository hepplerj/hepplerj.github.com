In my [last post](https://jasonheppler.org/2017/12/05/https/) I mentioned how
I had no concrete plans to migrate my site to Hugo despite testing out the
platform a bit.

Well, that was short lived. I blame Netlify.

Not Netlify per se, but my Jekyll setup on Netlify. The issue I ran into was
the *huge* amount of time it would take Jekyll to regenerate my site on
Netlfiy and redeploy it. It reached the point of unacceptable (including
setting up a Slack hook to get notified when the deploy started and when the
deploy ended -- just so I knew everything had successfully run in the ten to
fifteen minutes it was taking). This likely comes down to how I'm using [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to help compress CSS and images. But Hugo, as many others have noted, is *fast*.
And in this case, that speed is important to me.

So, here we are. I probably, again, broke a few things. And the site will
continue to go through some changes over time, as usual.^[I'm using a design
borrowed from [Kieran Healy](https://kieranhealy.org).] But so far, I'm liking
the new setup.
