A couple of years ago I wrote about some of [my favorite podcasts](http://jasonheppler.org/2012/09/03/podcasts/), and I thought it would be good to update the list. Some of those podcasts have ended, others still keep on, and I've added new ones to my [podcatcher of choice](https://overcast.fm/).

I'm currently subscribed to thirty-two podcasts. I might have a problem.[^1]

*	**[Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w), 5by5**: Back to Work was on my last
	list, and it still remains. I *love* this podcast. Dan Benjamin and Merlin
	Mann have wonderful chemistry together, and I usually end up with a lot of
	things to think about after each show---not only about #productivity,
	#creativity, #barriers, but also enjoy their detours into parenting, comic
	books, and [Dan's phobias](http://5by5.tv/b2w/85).
*	**[The Dan Benjamin Hour](http://5by5.tv/dbh), 5by5**: A newcomer to my
	list, DBH sometimes strikes me as part [The
	Frequency](http://5by5.tv/frequency), part [Geek
	Friday](http://5by5.tv/geekfriday). Dan and [Haddie
	Cooke](http://5by5.tv/people/haddie-cooke) cover a range of topics
	regarding technology, gear, entertainment, and culture. Plus, the on-air
	chemisty between Dan and Haddie is great.
*	**[DLC](http://5by5.tv/dlc), 5by5**: Yes, another 5by5 show. No, this isn't
	the last one. The DLC podcast hosted by Jeff Cannata and Christian Spicer
	is among my favorite gaming-focused podcasts, and every week they talk to
	somebody in or near the gaming industry. And lest you think it's all about
	video games, it's not! Although video games are often the focus, they also
	have a regular Tabletop Time where they share their favorite boardgames.
	I've picked up many suggestions from that segment of the show.
*	**Additional 5by5 shows**: Although they're produced less often, both [The
	Frequency](http://5by5.tv/frequency) and [Grit](http://5by5.tv/grit) are
	great shows---The Frequency for its news, and Grit for it's discussions on
	work culture. I'm also an occassional listener of the [Latest in
	Paleo](http://5by5.tv/paleo) show hosted by Angelo Coppola.
*	**[Roderick On the Line](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/)**: What can
	one say about Roderick on the Line with John Roderick and Merlin Mann? Just
	keep a small bag packed, and keep moving or get out of the way.
	#supertrain.
*	**[Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm/)**: I was sad when
	[Hypercritical](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical) and [Build and
	Analyze](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze) came to an end, but delighted when
	[Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/), [Casey
	Liss](http://www.caseyliss.com/) (who?), and [John
	Siracusa](http://hypercritical.co/) started a new tech podcast. These are,
	as you might expect, frequently *long* shows, but also good for keeping up
	on Apple news or playing in the background while I do some [C-level
	writing](http://www.firstdraftpodcast.com/post/94616362588/s1e9-the-greatest-lie-the-writing-devil-ever).
*	**[Reconcilable Differences](http://www.relay.fm/rd), RelayFM**: Launched
	just this week, this is one of the shows I always dreamed about. Hosted by
	John Siracusa and Merlin Mann, the show pitches itself as "try[ing] to
	figure out exactly how they got this way." The first episode is excellent,
	and I only expect that future episodes will remain that way.
*	**[Nerds on Draft](http://www.nerdsondraft.com/welcome/)**: Technology
	*and* beer, in one podcast. Hosted by [Gabe
	Weatherhead](http://macdrifter.com/) and [Jeff
	Hunsberger](http://technologynotes.net/), the show opens with a particular
	beer or style before doing a deep dive into a technology topic.
	I enjoy the perspectives Gabe and Jeff bring, and their beer
	recommendations are top notch. (They even built a [great
	app](http://tapcellar.com/).)
*	**[Talking Machines](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/)**: Recommended to
	me by [Lincoln Mullen](http://lincolnmullen.com/blog/the-talking-machines-podcast/), Talking Machines is an excellent podcast on
	machine learning. The shows are very well produced, and feature interviews
	with researchers in the field. For starters, check out their episode with
	[David
	Blei](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/blog/2015/5/7/interdisciplinary-data-and-helping-humans-be-creative).
*	**[This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/), NPR**: Probably
	among the most famous (or, at least, most subscribed to) podcasts. Ira Glass
	always produces great shows, and TAL is usually a weekly listen for me.
*	**[Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/), NPR**: Radiolab is also probably
	a contender of most-famous-podcast, covering topics on science, philosophy,
	and human experience. Again, it likely needs no introduction.
*	**[Backstory](http://backstoryradio.org/)**: Backstory with Ed Ayers, Peter
	Onuf, and Brian Balogh is probably my favorite history-oriented podcast.
	The show interviews historians whose work often relates to some issue
	straight out of today's headlines.
*	**[Who Makes Cents?](http://whomakescentspodcast.com/)**: Hosted by
	historians Betsy Beasley and David Stein, Who Makes Cents is a monthly show
	focusing on the history of capitalism. They interview historians whose work
	explain how capitalism has changed over time. An excellent show that always
	seems to add another book to my ever-growing "To Read" list.
*	**[You Are Not So Smart](http://www.relay.fm/cortex/)**: Hosted by [David
	McRaney](http://davidmcraney.com/), You Are Not So Smart is a show about
	self delusion, cognitive biases, heuristics, and logical fallacies.
	A well-produced and entertaining show that mixes stories, monologues, and
	interviews with experts.
*	**[The
	JuntoCast](http://earlyamericanists.com/the-junto-podcast-network/the-juntocast/)**:
	Although I'm not an early Americanist by training, the JuntoCast is
	excellent listening for anyone interested in the history of the early
	American republic. Their roundtables on historiographical discussions have
	to be the best out there right now (their episode on Edmund Morgan's
	*[American Slavery, American
	Freedom](http://thejuntocast.com/archives/ep-17-morgans-american-slavery-american-freedom/)*
	is wonderful. It was like being back in a graduate seminar.)
*	**[The Incomparable](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/)**:
	The Incomparable is a weekly show on geeky topics regarding movies, books,
	television, comics, and other topics. Usually a rotating panel of guests
	anchored by [Jason Snell](http://sixcolors.com/), I don't catch every
	episode but I often enjoy their discussions on popular culture. [Their
	*Star Wars* series](https://www.theincomparable.com/work/starwars/) include
	my favorite episodes. And how many pdocasts out there can [record for an
	hour and
	a half](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/243/index.php)
	about a two-minute long teaser trailer?
*	**[The First Draft Podcast](http://firstdraftpodcast.com)**: An odd show.
	But worth listening to from time to time.

There are many more shows I didn't cover in detail here, but if you're interested: [Still Untitled: The Adam Savage Project](http://www.tested.com/still-untitled-the-adam-savage-project/), [Buddhist Geeks](http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/), [5by5 at the Movies](http://5by5.tv/movies), [5by5 Specials](http://5by5.tv/specials), [5by5 After Dark](http://5by5.tv/afterdark), [The Talk Show](http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/), [You Look Nice Today](http://youlooknicetoday.com/) (which might be coming back?), [TeeVee](https://www.theincomparable.com/teevee/), usually for the *Game of Thrones* discussion, [Serial](http://serialpodcast.org/), [Mac Power Users](http://www.relay.fm/mpu), [The Dalrymple Report](http://www.loopinsight.com/thedalrymplereport/), [Cortex](http://www.relay.fm/cortex/), [Digital Campus](http://digitalcampus.tv/).

[^1]: In my defense, I don't listen to *every* episode.
