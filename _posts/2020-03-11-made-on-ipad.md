I've long tried out a variety of computing devices for doing my work. Back when I first started graduate school, I picked up a Dell Mini as my primary computer. About a year later I built a desktop computer, but kept using the Mini for quite a while until it was replaced by a larger Dell laptop. All three of these computers were eventually replaced by a MacBook Pro. 

Enter the iPad Mini. Given my prior interest in small computing devices, I was keenly interested in giving the small iPad a whirl -- and it stuck, at least a bit. It was great for attending meetings or talks where I could type up notes, or for reading articles or books. But it never became a primary mode of work for me. I always returned to the MacBook Pro. 

That started to change about four years ago when I picked up Apple's 9.7" iPad Pro, which I recently just replaced with the latest iPad Air. I now work on the iPad daily, and oftentimes can spend up to eighty percent of my day on the device. 

So, what happened?

# Why did I even get one? 



# Why I love the iPad

**WWDC 2019** was a game changer in the way that iPad worked. Apple announced that the iPad would run a new operating system separate from iOS called iPadOS -- no longer retrofitting iOS into the larger device, but devoting itself to new interactions, designs, and features.

When Steve Jobs debuted the iPad in 2010, he described a third type of computing device -- something between a phone and a laptop -- that could exist only if it did some key things *better*. Apple imagined this as their tablet, useful for browsing the web, reading books, doing email, playing music or video. But the iPad today is more powerful and more capable, to the point that it has **replaced my laptop for most tasks**.  

I still use my MacBook Pro daily as well, and for some tasks like development it's just a better experience. (I once tried using RStudio Server from an iPad as my R development environment. But, that was not a...terrific experience.)
