## Leslie Berlin's "Joker" Article

Here's the text of Leslie Berlin's *Bloomberg* article (cited [here][8] on the Steve Jobs "Joker" 
document:

> In June 1976, Steve Jobs went looking for someone to print the manual for 
> the Apple I computer, the first product from the company he had started with 
> Steve Wozniak and Ron Wayne a few months earlier. Jobs’s friend Regis 
> McKenna, head of Silicon Valley’s premier advertising and public relations 
> firm, suggested he contact Mike Rose, who ran a small advertising agency in 
> Los Altos.  After speaking with Jobs on the phone, Rose was leery.  He wrote 
> a short note to his business partner, warning him that young Mr. Jobs would 
> be in touch. That note, which Mike Rose donated to the Silicon Valley 
> Archives at Stanford in 1998, is reproduced below. “They are 2 guys – they 
> build kits – operate out of a garage,” Rose wrote. “Sounds flakey. Watch 
> it!”

> The note is wonderful in part because it reveals how much Silicon Valley has 
> changed in 35 years.  In 1976, two guys trying to launch a tech company from 
> a garage in the heart of Silicon Valley were flakes. Now, someone in Mike 
> Rose’s position might well ask for a piece of the action – payment in the 
> form of a small bit of stock, perhaps?

> The note also shows us that in some ways, the twenty-one-year-old Steve Jobs 
> was not too different from the man he later became.  Jobs may have struck 
> Rose as a “joker,” but the young entrepreneur is concerned about secrecy 
> (“Wouldn’t trust me,” Rose writes) and drives a hard bargain (“wants it for 
> nothing”).

> In the end, Jobs rejected Rose’s bid as too high and went on to have a 
> typesetter handle production of the Apple I manual.   That manual, too, 
> shows how much has changed in thirty-five years.  On the cover, the company 
> was called Apple Computer, not Apple.  The logo was not the famous fruit 
> with a missing bite, but an elaborate illustration, drawn by Ron Wayne, 
> depicting Isaac Newton reading a book – reading a book! – beneath an apple 
> tree.  [A quote from Wordsworth encircles the drawing: “A mind forever 
> voyaging through strange seas of thought – alone.”]
> And the product described in the manual’s twelve pages, while advanced for 
> its day, is far from the elegant, user-friendly device associated with Apple 
> today.  The manual includes schematics and instructions for a test to run 
> upon starting the machine:  Step Two: “Type- 0 : A9 b 0 b AA b 20 b EF b EF 
> b FF b E8 b 8A b 4C b 2 b 0 (RET)”.  And then there is the description of 
> the computer itself: “The Apple Computer is fully assembled, tested, and 
> burned in.  The only external devices necessary for operation of the system 
> are: An ASCII encoded keyboard, a video display monitor, and AC power 
> sources of 8 to 10 Volts (RMS) @ 3 amps and 28 Volts (RMS) @ 1 amp.”
