  <div class="post-content">
    <h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>
<p>I may change due dates or assignments. I will always give you plenty of notice of changes, which will always be intended for your benefit. Students must satisfactorily complete all assignments (including participation assignments) in order to pass this course.</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity</h3>
<p>You are expected to know and follow Stanford University’s policies on academic integrity &lt;<a href="http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/communitystandards/integrity" class="uri">http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/communitystandards/integrity</a>&gt;.</p>
<h3 id="course-website-and-privacy">Course website and privacy</h3>
<p>You will have to make an account on WordPress for your online writing assignments. You may use either your real name or a <em>nom de plume</em> (which I will keep confidential). You retain the copyright to everything that you write.</p>
<h3 id="late-work">Late work</h3>
<p><strong>Late work will not be accepted</strong>. If an assignment is late, it is an automatic no credit / zero.</p>
<p>Exceptions to this policy may (very rarely) be made, but only when there are extenuating circumstances such as a personal emergency or an illness requiring professional medical attention. These circumstances must be documented to my satisfaction and brought to my attention <em>before</em> the deadline for an assignment arrives.</p>
<h4 id="hour-policy">48-Hour Policy</h4>
<p>With that said, I know things can get stressful during the quarter. To help you do your best work, I offer a 48-hour extension policy. Each student will get 48 hours that they can “spend” in 12 hour increments. You can only use this on blog assignments and on components of your final project. To use this, email me before the assignment is due, letting me know you’re using it, and after you’ve completed the assignment so I can mark it as done.</p>
<h3 id="participation-and-attendance">Participation and attendance</h3>
<p>Your attendance is expected every day without exception. We will be working closely in community, so I hope you will develop a good working relationship with everyone in the class. You should complete readings and assignments before class each day, and you are expected to actively participate by listening, questioning, and speaking.</p>
<p>If you must be absent, I request that you notify me by e-mail in advance of class meeting. Even if you are absent, you must turn in assignments before the time when our class meets.</p>
<p>After the first two absences from class, the relevant portion of your grade for the class will be significnatly lowered for each absence.</p>
<h3 id="communications">Communications</h3>
<p>I am always glad to meet with you in person. You can make an appointment for office hours by e-mailing me. If none of my scheduled office hours work for you, we can find another time that does. From time to time I may offer online office hours on Slack.</p>
<p>I prefer Slack for most communication, but you can also contact me via &lt;<a href="mailto:jheppler@stanford.edu">jheppler@stanford.edu</a>&gt;. I will reply to your messages in a timely manner (but never on a Sunday). <strong>However, don’t expect an immediate response</strong>. I will follow up with you within twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>I will send official course communications to your Stanford e-mail address, which you should check regularly.</p>
<p><strong>I will discuss grades only in person.</strong></p>
<h3 id="electronic-devices">Electronic devices</h3>
<p>Because this is a digital history class you should feel free to bring laptops and other devices to work on projects or take and consult notes. However, if I feel laptops and tablets are becoming a distraction you will be asked to put them away. I reserve the right to ban laptops and tablets if they become a problem. Except for extraordinary circumstances, I can’t see any reason why you would need to use a cell phone in class, so please stow phones before class begins.</p>
<h3 id="disabilities">Disabilities</h3>
<p>Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is made. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066, URL: http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/oae).</p>
