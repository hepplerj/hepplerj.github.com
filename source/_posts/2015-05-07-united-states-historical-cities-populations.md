intro: We're building a dataset of historical U.S. cities.

Thanks to the hard work of Erik Steiner and Jan Lahmeyer, the [Spatial History
Project](http://spatialhistory.stanford.edu) has compiled what I believe is the
[most complete dataset on U.S. population
figures](https://github.com/cestastanford/historical-us-city-populations) over
two centuries. The dataset tries to compile historical city populations
decennially between 1790 and 2010 for cities above 2,500 people (when the U.S.
Census Bureau first added them to their records), but the data is spottier for
cities with populations below 2,500. 

There's more thorough documentation in the README about the sources for the
data and method of compilation. We've placed the [data on
Github](https://github.com/cestastanford/historical-us-city-populations) for
use and improvement by others, so I hope you'll check it out. Feel free to
submit pull requests or get in touch with Erik or I with questions or
suggestions.
