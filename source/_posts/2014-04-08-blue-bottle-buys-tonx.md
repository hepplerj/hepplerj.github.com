 in *Wired*:

> The San Francisco Bay Area-based Blue Bottle, along with other formerly regional
roasters like Portland’s Stumptown, Chicago’s Intelligentsia, and North
Carolina’s Counter Culture helped kick off a brewed coffee movement in the
United States. And while all have grown beyond their original city limits, none
have really threatened to become the next Starbucks, or even Chipotle. Given its
recent investment round, however, along with its purchase of Handsome Roasters
in Los Angeles, Blue Bottle is clearly looking to get big. Tonx immediately
gives Blue Bottle a much better Web and app capability than it now has.

> It’s also a good deal for Tonx, which was attempting to raise more money to
purchase its own coffee roaster (it currently has a contract deal where it rents
one on the weekends) and open a store front. While neither announced a price,
Tonx did abandon a $4 million fundraising round it had been pursuing recently.
Presumably, the deal would be on par with that. It’s a big win for the three
year-old roaster that’s based in Los Angeles, but lives all over the internet.

Some good news for two of my favorite roasters.
