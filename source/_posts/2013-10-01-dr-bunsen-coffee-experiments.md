Dr. Bunsen runs a relatively controlled experiment on ideas about coffee brewing. Great post, although I would quibble with a few points (he doesn't specify his AeroPress brewing method, there's no indication on the ratio of beans to water that would have an affect on flavor). But overall, a lovely experiment. 

UPDATE: Marco Arment [responds with similar concerns](http://www.marco.org/2013/10/01/coffee-experiments).
