intro: "Our basic approach, whether we're staff or faculty, is research-driven."

Interesting piece over at the Duke Library blog on defining digital
humanities (hat tip to [Mike Widner](https://twitter.com/mwidner)).

> The research model is going to be harder to quantify. We do have some
measurable components: we provide some services, and we do (or will do)
some grant-funded projects. We also produce output, including code, web
services, papers, articles, and blog posts. But for the most part we
focus on building pieces of ever-evolving, ever-growing, resources that
are never 'finished'---resources that are harder to quantify than finished
books or articles, websites or databases are. So, in some ways we look
more like faculty than staff, in other ways we look more
entrepreneurial. Startups take risks on building big things, hoping, of
course, that they'll be profitable. Very often the things they try don't
work, but sometimes they do, or sometimes they suggest a completely
different (but better) direction. The thing is: you'll never catch
anything if you don't put your fishing line in the water. We try to
control for risk, to fish where the fishing's good, but our basic
posture is still research-driven and so to some extent risk bearing.
