Thanks to my colleague (and [co-host](http://firstdraftpodcast.com)) [Elijah Meeks](https://twitter.com/Elijah_Meeks/status/513171905549832193) for pointing me to a project by Nils Weidmann, who has put together CShapes -- an R package and GIS shapefile of country boundaries and capitals between 1946 and 2008.
