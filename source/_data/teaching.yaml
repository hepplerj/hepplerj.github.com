    semester: Spring 2018
    description: This workshop emphasizes hands-on learning of working with network data and visualization. Historians working out the complex documentary relationships between people and institutions can often find surprising, or previously unexplored, connections by using network analysis and its visual representations. This workshop will help participants familiarize themselves with basic network-analysis vocabulary as well as using Gephi for network analysis and visualization.

    semester: Spring 2018
    description: This course confronts the current and potential influence of digital media on the theory and practice of history. We will focus on resources enabling new forms of scholarship, looking at tools for visualization and text analysis for generating historical interpretations, and explore alternative forms of publishing, design, and research. The course covers a range of readings along with a critical engagement with tools and resources. Students will also contribute to a digital spatial exhibit on the history of Omaha.

    description: The visualization of historical and literary data has become a common practice in digital humanities, drawing on older traditions of visualizing in these disciplines. A variety of out-of-the-box tools exist for easily jumping in to data and information visualization, but when we use these tools we run the risk of research questions being wedged into a tool rather than the tool fitting the research. This course introduces students to humanities visualizations, using a programming language that let researchers prioritize their questions over the requirements of ready-made tools.

    location: Stanford University
    datestart: 2014-09-01 00:00:00 -0800
    dateend: 2014-12-17 00:00:00 -0800
    semester: Fall 2014
    url: https://jasonheppler.org/teaching/hist205f.2014/
    description: This is a hands-on course that introduces students to the use of digital tools and sources to conduct original historical research, analyze and interpret findings, and communicate results. Digital history is an interdisciplinary approach that seeks to bring digital technology into conversation with humanities disciplines and, specifically, seeks to analyze, synthesize, and present knowledge through computational media. Digital historians create digital archival collections, databases, digitize objects, analyze humanistic material in digital form, and addresses scholarly questions often difficult, if not impossible, to ask using non-computational methods.
