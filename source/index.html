<h2>Hi. I'm Jason.</h2>

<p></p>

<p>I am the Academic Technology Specialist in the <a href="http://history.stanford.edu">Department of History</a> at <a href="http://stanford.edu">Stanford University</a>, where I collaborate with faculty and graduate students on digital history research, teaching, and publishing. Most of my work focuses on data visualization, humanities design, and digital and spatial history. I write here regularly on <a href="{{site.url}}/archives/">my blog</a>, contribute to the <a href="http://blogwest.org">BlogWest</a> group blog, and co-host <a href="http://www.fiddly.fm/firstdraft/">The First Draft</a> podcast and <a href="http://www.fiddly.fm/overanalyze/">Overanalyze</a> podcast.</p>

<p>I am a 20th century U.S. historian specializing in environmental, the North American West, and digital and public history. I am currently working on a book manuscript titled <em>Machines in the Valley: Community, Urban Change, and Environmental Politics in Silicon Valley</em>. The book describes the emergence of the Silicon Valley as a political project closely tied to the region's environment, while also charting a story of "nature" becoming a central political issue. I'll have more <a href="http://notebook.jasonheppler.org/machines-valley-manuscript/">information about my manuscript</a> in my <a href="http://notebook.jasonheppler.org/">Open History Notebook</a> where I keep notes and research material for various projects.</p>
