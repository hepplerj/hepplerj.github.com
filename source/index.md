<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi. My name is <a href="/about/">Jason Heppler</a>.</h1>
<h2>I design digital projects for research and learning.</h2>
</div> 

I am currently the digital engagement librarian and assistant professor of history at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, where I lead initiatives in digital humanities. Previously, I led digital history, data visualization, and humanities software design projects at Stanford University, and before that managed the [William F. Cody Digital Archive](http://codyarchive.org). I'm also a founding member and co-lead of [Endangered Data Week](https://endangereddataweek.org), helping raise awareness around threats to publicly available data. I'm currently a mentor with [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/). 

I've [taught](/teaching/) classes on programming, design, visualization, web cartography, and network analysis. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jaheppler), [Github](https://www.github.com/hepplerj), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonheppler/), and [Medium](https://medium.com/@jaheppler).

If it's a sensitive email, you can [grab my public key](https://jasonheppler.org/jasonheppler.asc) for that address or reach me at `jason.heppler@protonmail.com`. Iâ€™m also `jaheppler` on Keybase.
