Previously, I led [digital humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities), data visualization, and software design projects at Stanford University, and before that managed a [digital archive](http://cdrh.unl.edu).

I'm currently a mentor with [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/). I've [taught](/teaching/) classes on programming, design, visualization, web cartography, and network analysis.
