**Hi. I'm Jason**. I am a historian of twentieth-century United States history, with a focus on digital and computational history, urban environmental politics and policy, and the North American West. I am the [Digital Engagement Librarian](http://www.unomaha.edu/criss-library/about-us/staff-directory/jason-heppler.php) and [Assistant Professor of History](http://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-arts-and-sciences/history/) at the [University of Nebraska at Omaha](http://unomaha.edu), where I lead initiatives in digital engagement and public history. I am also affiliated faculty with UNO's [Center for Urban Sustainability](https://www.unomaha.edu/sustainability/center-for-urban-sustainability/index.php) and a Researcher with Stanford University's [Spatial History Project](http://spatialhistory.stanford.edu). I often write [here on my blog](/archives) and contribute to the [BlogWest](http://blogwest.org) group blog.

I also work on bicycle advocacy projects both on campus and in the community, like [Omaha Bikes](https://omahabikes.org/), the [Omaha Bike Network](http://livewellomaha.org/), the [League of American Bicyclists](http://bikeleague.org/), [People for Bikes](http://peopleforbikes.org), and [Mode Shift Omaha](https://modeshiftomaha.org/).

Other things I'm involved with: I serve as a community representative for the [Digital Public Library of America](https://dp.la/), helped plan and host the first annual [Endangered Data Week](http://endangereddataweek.org), was a member of the research staff at the [Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis](http://cesta.stanford.edu) at Stanford University, and an academic technology specialist at the [Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research](http://cidr.stanford.edu) at Stanford University. Before joining Stanford, I was a project manager on the [William F. Cody Archive](http://codyarchive.org) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's [Center for Digital Research in the Humanities](http://cdrh.unl.edu).
