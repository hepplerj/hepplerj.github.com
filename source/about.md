Hi. I'm Jason. I am a historian of the twentieth-century United States, with a focus on digital and computational history, urban environmental politics and policy, and the North American West. I'm an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, where I lead initiatives in digital engagement and public history.

I also work on bicycle advocacy projects both on campus and in the community, like [Omaha Bikes](https://omahabikes.org/), the [Omaha Bike Network](http://livewellomaha.org/), the [League of American Bicyclists](http://bikeleague.org/), [People for Bikes](http://peopleforbikes.org), and [Mode Shift Omaha](https://modeshiftomaha.org/).

Other things I'm involved with: I serve as a community representative for the [Digital Public Library of America](https://dp.la/), I am a volunteer researcher with [Data for Democracy](http://datafordemocracy.org), and co-organize the annual [Endangered Data Week](http://endangereddataweek.org). Before joining UNO, I was a member of the research staff at the [Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis](http://cesta.stanford.edu) at Stanford University, and an academic technology specialist at the [Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research](http://cidr.stanford.edu) at Stanford University. Before joining Stanford, I was a project manager on the [William F. Cody Archive](http://codyarchive.org) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's [Center for Digital Research in the Humanities](http://cdrh.unl.edu).
