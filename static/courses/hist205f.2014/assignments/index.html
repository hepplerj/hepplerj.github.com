  <h3 id="blogging">Blogging</h3>

<p>At the end of each week, complete a blog post on the week’s readings and exercises to the course blog. You will complete six of these over the course of the quarter. I expect more than just a summary of the readings. Think about the kinds of questions
they raised for you, the themes and issues that emerged across the readings,
and how those readings might relate to the previous week’s readings. During some weeks you’ll also have <strong>homework exercises</strong> that get you hands-on with a tool. If that’s the case, your post should put the readings in conversation with the tool(s) used during the week. Blog
posts are due by <strong>Saturday at midnight</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="discussion-questions">Discussion questions</h3>

<p>Each week we have readings, you will be required to submit a set of at least three discussion
questions based on the readings that address the topics and themes of the
readings. Discussion questions should be posted to the course blog and will be due
by <strong>midnight on the Sunday before class</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="class-participation">Class participation</h3>

<p>Come to class prepared to discuss the texts and share ideas about the readings
and digital tools or methods you worked with over the course of the week. Participation points are determined by your contribution to the discussion, in
addition to the discussion questions you submit to CourseWork.  Doing careful
readings of the texts, raising questions about what you’ve read, and
contributing thoughtfully to class discussion will ensure success.</p>

<h3 id="presentations">Presentations</h3>

<p>In Week 8 and Week 9 you will be presenting on your research. In Week 8 you
will present to the class your progress on your digital project. In Week 9 we
will hold a public electronic poster session on our digital projects in the Wallenberg Learning Theater.</p>

<h3 id="book-review">Book review</h3>

<p>You will be required to acquire one book from the list below and write a three
page book review. Remember that this is not a summary of the text. Rather, you
will engage with the ideas, arguments, themes, and interpretation offered by
the author(s). The book review can be submitted <strong>at any time in the quarter</strong>
and <strong>can be resubmitted as often as you would like</strong> if you are not happy with
the grade you are given. The final book review, however, is absolutely due on
<strong>November 24</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="course-project-and-presentation">Course project and presentation</h3>

<p>The core of the course will be an original digital history project. You will
complete a historical analysis using digital methods we cover in the course
and can approach the history of Silicon Valley in many ways. Perhaps your
group is interested in creating an interactive map of historical technology
companies in order to understand the growth of industry in the Bay Area. Maybe
you are interested in analyzing the text of the <em>Palo Alto Times</em> in order to
understand how the newspaper discussed high technology industrialization over
time. You might be interested in creating an interactive exhibit using
photographs, video, and text that explains some element of Silicon Valley’s
history. Maybe you’re interested in the public history of Stanford and want to
explore why certain buildings are named after people important in the history
of Silicon Valley and the role they played in the Valley’s history. The topic
of the research is up to you. We will be examining many entry-level tools in
this course that will lend themselves to historical research, and your
projects will explore both the history of Silicon Valley as well as testing
the digital method’s usefulness to offering new perspectives and explanations.</p>

<p>The final project should be substantial and engage with both the history and
the methods learned in the course. The project can be limited to a single
method – perhaps mapping is the best approach, for example – but should
engage with the historical material in a significant way. If your project
tends to focus on a particular person, for example, don’t just recount the
person’s life. Thoughtfully examine their contribution to the history of
Silicon Valley, analyze and interpret the historical evidence, and draw
conclusions. The final project is due at the electronic poster session on <strong>December 1</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

<p>Assignments in the course will receive these weights. For collaborative work,
your grade will be determined both by your individual contribution and by the
overall quality of the project.</p>
