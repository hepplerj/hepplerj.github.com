# Visualization Design

Edward Tufte suggests that graphical excellence is defined by "that which gives the viewer the **greatest number of ideas**, in the **shortest time**, with the **least ink**, the **smallest space**, and which **tells the truth about data**."

# Gestalt psychology

We refer to this as .hl[Gestalt psychology], an old practice for understanding how humans perceive patterns. The principles of Gestalt psychology attempt to explore how we view separate visual elements as a whole.

**Easy**: install the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org)

```r
install.packages('tidyverse')
```

**Expert**: install from GitHub

```r
devtools::install_github('tidyverse/ggplot2')
```
And since we'll need it later:

```r
install.packages(c('historydata', 'gapminder'))
```

The `tidyverse` is a collection of several packages useful for data manipulation, tidying, and visualization.

- `ggplot2`, for data visualization
- `dplyr`, for data manipulation
- `tidyr`, for data tidying
- `readr`, for data import
- `purrr`, for functional programming
- `tibble`, a re-imagining of data frames
]

.left-column[
### ggplot

]

.right-column[
ggplot2 is a data visualization package that uses

- a grammer of graphics: breaking up graphs into components
- popular method for creating explanatory and exploratory graphics

Supplementary packages for ggplot are available for more customization and function, for example:

- `gganimate`: create animations
- `gghighlight`: highlight lines and points
- `ggrepel`: automatic adjustment of text labels
- `ggbeeswarm`: add non-overlapping points

# Grammar of Graphics
---

`ggplot` has three essential components:

- **data**: a dataset you are visualizing
- **aesthetic mappings**: that identify coordinates (what to map to x and y), and assigning variables to visual elements (color, shape, size, etc.)
- **geometric layer**: a type of graphic (point, line, boxplot, bars, maps, etc.)

---

![Illustrating ggplot components.](images/ggplot-illustration.png)

- `geom_*`: type of graphic
- `stat_*`: statistical representation of the data
- `scale_*`: visual values (axis scale, color scale)
- `facet_*`: divide plot into subplots
- `theme(_*)`: adjust background colors, grid lines, font sizes, etc.

# The Grammar of Graphics

A visualization concept created by Leland Wilkinson (1999) to **define** the elements of statistical graphics:

> "... describes the meaning of what we do when we construct statistical graphics ... More than a taxonomy ... Computational system based on the underlying mathematics of representing statistical functions of data."

Adapted by the creator of `ggplot`, Hadley Wickham, in 2009. `ggplot` offers a:
> 1. **consistent and simple syntax** for 
> 2. **describing statistical graphics**, and is
> 3. **highly modular** to break graphs into 
> 4. **semantic components**.

# The Grammar of Graphics

Let's break down what we did with the `ggplot` code. The code for our previous bar chart looked like:

```r
ggplot(data = us_state_populations, aes(x = year, y = population, fill = state)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  ggtitle("U.S. Historical State Populations") +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Population")
```

`ggplot` needs:

> 1. mapping of **data**
> 2. to **aesthetic attributes**
> 3. using **geometric objects**
> 4. with data **statistically transformed**
> 5. and, if needed, mapped onto a **facet** or **coordinate system**

# The Grammar of Graphics

**data**: data as an R data frame 

**coordinate system**: describe 2D space data is projected onto, such as Cartesian coordinates, polar coordinates, and map projections.

**geoms**: describe the geometric objects that represent data, such as points, lines, and polygons.

**aesthetics**: describe visual characteristics that represent data, such as position, size, color, and shape. 

**scales**: for each aesthetic, describe how visual characteristic is converted to display values, such as log scales, color scales, size scales, and shape scales.

**stats**: describe statistical transformations such as counts, means, medians, or regression lines.

**facets**: describe how data is split into small multiples.

<span id="smaller">
See the `ggplot` [`geom_bar` documentation](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/geom_bar.html) for the differences in the `stat` flag. By default, `geom_bar` uses "stat='count'" which sets the height of the bar proportion to the number of cases in each group. Since we want the height of the bars to represent values in the data, we use "stat='identity'" to map a variable to the `y` aesthetic.

with data **statistically transformed**

Name      | Description 
----      | -----------
bin       | Divide continuous range into bins, and count number of points in each
boxplot   | Compute statistics necessary for boxplot
contour   | Calculate contour lines
density   | Compute 1d density estimate
identity  | Identity transformation, f (x) = x
jitter    | Jitter values by adding small random value
qq        | Calculate values for quantile-quantile plot
quantile  | Quantile regression
smooth    | Smoothed conditional mean of y given x
summary   | Aggregate values of y for given x
unique    | Remove duplicated observations

and, if needed, mapped onto a **facet** or **coordinate system**
