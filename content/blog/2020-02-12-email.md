Email is *kind of* amazing. Lots of us slag on it, and I'm quick to admit I'm happy as a Slack user or Basecamp user who appreciates the chance to cut down on the amount of work email I receive. But I also get lots of great stuff, like newsletters (from [Anne](https://annehelen.substack.com), [Lincoln](https://buttondown.email/lmullen), [Alan](https://buttondown.email/ayjay/), [Dan](https://buttondown.email/dancohen)).[^1] The best of that email are those who encounter my work.

[^1]: Maybe it's a confirmation bias, but I think there's something to be said about how newletters have seeming taken the place of blogging.

One of my absolute favorite things about being a digital historian is how public it is -- we're not just writing things for other people in academia, we're producing work that's intentionally public-facing and invites engagement. And that engagement happens all the time. As a writer, that is thrilling.

It's hard to express just how powerful it is to have someone drop you a note, explaining that your [little history project](http://www.codystudies.org) on the Internet about Buffalo Bill Cody and his hiring of Native Americans for the Wild West expeditions caught their attention. To get a note from someone whose grandfather was once part of the Wild West expedition, and asking if I had more information about them. To get a note from a high school student telling me they appreciate me [sharing some work openly](http://framingredpower.org). To hear from college students that [find a project enlightening](https://cameronblevins.org/gotp/) for thinking about a historical process. To be invited to participate in related projects or new initiatives. 

All because I made something for the Internet. All because I included an easy way to reach me by email.
