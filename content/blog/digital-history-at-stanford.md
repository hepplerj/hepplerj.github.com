*[This post originally appeared at [Digital Humanities at Stanford](http://digitalhumanities.stanford.edu) on 2013-10-21]*

Last week we went live with [Digital History at Stanford](http://digitalhistory.stanford.edu), a space where I am trying to centralize information about the various digital research and pedagogy going on in the [History Department](http://history.stanford.edu) at Stanford.

The space originally started as a way for me to put projects that were in progress, of which I have a few that are under active development. As these projects grew and I began writing up resources, planning workshops, and learning about other events around campus, I realized we could transform the space into something much more usable for the department and a wider audience interested in digital history. The projects receive a lot of cross-promotion as well, showing up on [Digital Humanities at Stanford](http://digitalhumanities.stanford.edu) and on the [department's main website](http://history.stanford.edu). 

The Digital History site also helps advertise projects not affiliated with the [Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA)](http://cesta.stanford.edu). Many faculty members in the History Department have a connection to the [Spatial History Project](http://spatialhistory.stanford.edu), but not all projects being undertaken in the department applies to spatial history. So, the space serves as a place for faculty and graduate student projects to live during development and later point to when a project has achieved its final form. 

I anticipate future changes to the site, primarily to the section on teaching. Right now the space helps advertise workshops, talks, and events around Stanford that fall under the umbrella of digital humanities. But going forward, I want the space to also include syllabi, course websites, resources from reading groups, and other material used in the teaching of digital history. The resources section will likely expand as well to broadly encompass more digital history methods and approaches. 

Digital History at Stanford is in its early stages, so you can expect the site to expand going forward.
