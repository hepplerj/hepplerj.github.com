I've been getting a bit involved with bicycle advocacy in Omaha, especially now that I'm starting to commute to work by bike. As part of this, I wondered about the safey of bicyclists and pedestrians in the city. So, I threw together [a small R Shiny application](https://jheppler.shinyapps.io/omaha-bikes/) for exploring pedestrian and bicycling accidents in Omaha.

It's a fairly simple application, using some data provided by the Nebraska Department of Roads. You can find all of the [code and data on Github](https://github.com/hepplerj/omaha-bikes).

If you're interested in getting involved, hook up with some local and national organizations:

- [Nebraska Bicycling Alliance](http://www.nebike.org/)
- [Mode Shift Omaha](https://modeshiftomaha.org/)
- [League of American Bicyclists](http://bikeleague.org/)
