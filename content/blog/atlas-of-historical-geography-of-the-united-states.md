I am thrilled to see that the University of Richmond's Digital Scholarship Lab 
has launched the Atlas of [Historical Geography of the United 
States](http://dsl.richmond.edu/historicalatlas/). Beautifully designed and 
wonderful maps both georectified and flat plates. Wonderfully done. What's not to love?
