Dan Cohen <a href="http://www.dancohen.org/2011/03/01/what-scholars-want-from-the-digital-public-library-of-america/">shares his talk</a> at the Digital Public Library of America meeting at Harvard on March 1, 2011. He addresses several issues important to scholars, including reliable metadata, serendipity, and asks libraries to be aware scholars will want to use libraries in ways they haven't anticipated. Takeaway quote: &quot;If we want to think about the Digital Public Library of America from the scholarâ€™s point of view, we must think about how to replicate those [analog] signals while taking advantage of the technology.&quot;

UPDATE: Amanda French also <a href="http://amandafrench.net/2011/03/01/imagine-a-national-digital-library-i-wonder-if-we-can/">shares her talk</a> on the National Digital Library.
