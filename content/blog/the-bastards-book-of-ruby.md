If you're looking for an excellent starting point for learning Ruby (besides, of course, the [Rubyist Historian](http://www.jasonheppler.org/2010/12/10/the-rubyist-historian-the-series.html), check out ["The Bastards Book of Ruby" by Dan Nguyen](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/). He lays out his chapters really well, and I love how he has organized his table of contents and gives the status of each section's progress.
