I'm not a regular year-end blogger other than yearly theme posts but I wanted to take a moment at the end of 2024 to reflect amidst my own 2025 theme. One thing I've done pretty consistently since 2021 is to consider a yearly theme. Those have been:

- [2022](https://social.jasonheppler.org/2022/12/19/yearly-theme.html): Year of Lagom
- [2023](https://social.jasonheppler.org/2022/12/19/yearly-theme.html): Year of Festina Lente
- [2024](https://jasonheppler.org/2023/01/26/yearly-theme-2023/): Year of Work
- 2025: **Year of Foundation**

**Foundation** for me means a few things: new structures in place around health and fitness, some long-term work we’ll be doing around our acreage (barn restoration, garden expansion, orchard expansion, prairie re-wilding), career goals, and some long-term household tasks. So this year will be spent, in part, with an eye towards the future. We've also had, in some ways, a tough 2024. This year will serve as something of a reset as well.

# New Book, New Digital History, Next Book, New Blogging

In March 2024, my book *Silicon Valley and the Environmental Inequalities of High Tech Urbanism* came out with the University of Oklahoma Press. I’m really proud of how well the book turned out and it’s been well-received (including my neighbor, who unbeknownst to me told me he was reading it and really liked it. It’s the best review I could've gotten). As part of the book's release, I did a [couple](https://newnatures.org/greenhouse/events/booktalk/online-book-talk-heppler-silicon-valley-and-the-environmental-inequalities/) of [podcasts](https://draftingthepast.com/podcast-episodes/episode-45-jason-heppler-wants-tools-that-fit-his-questions/) and visited a few classes to talk about the project. All in all, I’m happy with the work. 

It was also a busy time around RRCHNM. We launched several new projects this year, including: 

- The [Arnham Postal History project](https://jasonheppler.org/2024/05/21/django-dev/), providing a database and mapping environment for tracing postal routes in the Netherlands during World War II.[^1]
- *La Sfera, or The Globe* by Gregorio Dati: Still in development but soft launched a couple of months ago, the project is a critical edition of Gregorio Dati’s *La sfera* manuscript written sometime around 1430. 
- [The Denig Manuscript]([https://denigmanuscript.org](https://denigmanuscript.org/)): In collaboration with the Winterthur Museum, Library and Gardens, we provide an interface to read, view, and hear the eighteenth-century illuminated manuscript by the Pennsylvania Dutch merchant Ludwig Denig. 
- [Connecting Threads]([https://connectingthreads.co.uk](https://connectingthreads.co.uk/)): Launched in October at an event in London, Connecting Threads seeks to investigate the consumption of Indian and Indian-imitation fabrics by communities of the global south. Much more is coming in the next year. To pursue that work, Deepthi Murali and I [won an NEH grant](https://rrchnm.org/news/deepthi-murali-and-jason-heppler-receive-neh-funding-for-connecting-threads-project/) to continue the work.
- Lots of progress on existing projects as well: a [redesign of the Bills of Mortality website]([https://deathbynumbers.org](https://deathbynumbers.org/)); new content for [Religious Ecologies]([https://religiousecologies.org](https://religiousecologies.org/)); new work for the [Civil War Graffiti project](https://www.neh.gov/news/kelly-receives-funding-civil-war-graffiti-preservation).
- I'll be teaching Digital Public History in our Digital Public Humanities certificate program again this spring.  
- I also began a new mentorship with one of our graduate students helping me out with development work. It's been a lot of fun and, I hope, engaging and useful for her. 

I've begun work on my next book as well this year. I'm returning to some work I completed in graduate school on the Sagebrush Rebellion in the northern plains. I'm hoping to spend a lot of time in the archives this year—in Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska—so I can make some further progress on the work. Relatedly, I've started a side blog/newsletter called [Tack & Ink](https://ink.jasonheppler.org) where I'll be writing about my research in progress. I hope you’ll consider subscribing.

# Life

2024 wasn't all work, of course. My family and I had a busy year of experiences: a big summer road trip through Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho; we attended concerts of Sarah Jarosz, NEEDTOBREATHE, Hozier, Bob Dylan, and Willie Nelson; visiting family; and lots of work around our acreage.
