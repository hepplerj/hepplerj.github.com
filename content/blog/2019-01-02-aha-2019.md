Tomorrow kicks of the [annual meeting of the American Historical Association](https://aha.confex.com/aha/2019/webprogram/start.html).  I'm on a [roundtable on Friday at 3:30pm](https://aha.confex.com/aha/2019/webprogram/Session17327.html) discussing cliometrics, quantitative history, and digital history with Ben Schmidt, Emily Merchant, John Theibault, Anelise Shrout, and Caleb McDaniel.  I'm really looking forward to chatting with folks, but especially eager to hear from my fellow panelists.
