In 2012, [I took my site down](http://jasonheppler.org/2012/01/18/standing_against_sopa/) in protest of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). 

It's time to stand up again.

We have just a few days left to contact Congress and the FCC on plans to dismantle net neutrality rules that were put in place two years ago. These rules ensure that internet service providers---Comcast, Verizon, and others---cannot block or throttle individual websites, charge fees for premium delivery, or favor their own content. But without them, ISPs can reshape the Internet to their liking. Companies are already doing this to bend the Internet to their liking: Comcast, for example, [throttled Netflix traffic](http://mattvukas.com/2014/02/10/comcast-definitely-throttling-netflix-infuriating/) until Netflix [agreed to a demand](https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-agrees-to-pay-comcast-to-improve-its-streaming-1393175346) to pay for a promise of higher streaming speeds. 

What you can do:

- [File a comment with the FCC](https://www.battleforthenet.com/). It's only a few moments of your time. File before July 14.
- Spread the word. Tell others about why they need to fight.

On July 12, I'll be [standing with other activists and companies](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) in a day of action to support net neutrality rules. Make your voice heard.
