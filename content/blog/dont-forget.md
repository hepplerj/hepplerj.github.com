title: Don't Forget Google Reader Goes Dark Monday

Dave Winer has a reminder that you should [download your Google Reader subscriptions list](http://dave.smallpict.com//2013/06/26/downloadYourGoogleReaderSubsBeforeMonday) before Monday. 

I've moved on to the free tier of Newsblur for syncing items between devices (and the free tier offers one more advantage: keeping my RSS reading limit very small since it only allows up to 64 sites) and ReadKit for my MacBook (I use Newsblur's iOS app on the mobile devices). I could probably give up syncing since the majority of my time is spent in front of my MacBook on a Wi-Fi connection. But in the case where I'd like access to my items, like riding Caltrain, I can access them on my phone. 

The end of Google Reader is probably going to be a good thing. An area of technology that had gone a bit stale may be invigorated by people looking for new solutions.
