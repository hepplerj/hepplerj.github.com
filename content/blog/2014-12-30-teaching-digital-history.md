In the fall quarter I taught, for the first time, [a digital history
course](http://jasonheppler.org/teaching/hist205f.2014/), a colloquium with undergraduate and graduate students from
history, computer science, journalism, and earth sciences. The course
was a blast to teach and I am extremely pleased with how the final
projects ended up. I had an amazing group of students who not only
seized upon the methods introduced in the course but also helped me to
clarify some of my own thinking and challenged some of my ideas.

The end of the course culminated in a *beta* version of a digital
history project that the students were free to choose on their own, so
long as the topic revolved around the history of Silicon
Valley.[^1] The projects:

- Emily Grubert, "[What is environmental impact? The evolution of topic in English-language environmental life cycle assessment journal articles, 1995-2014](http://stanford.edu/~gruberte/LCA_topics/205f/lca_topics.html)"
- Russell Burg, "[Blighted Modernity: Mapping Shantytowns in Park Chung
Hee's Seoul, 1963-66](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zWyv-Qdem2Ls.k0eakGugMyIA)"
- James Hanley and Wayne Shu, "[Silicon Valley Meets Wall Street](http://wayneshu.me/dh-project-website/)"
- Jenny Farman, "[Women in CS at Stanford](http://web.stanford.edu/~jfarman/stanford-cs-women.html)"
- Paul Carroll, "[Silicon Valley, according to the *New York Times*](https://github.com/paulc3/history205f)"

They compressed a lot of work into a short amount of time (quarters are 
*so* short), and I'm quite happy with the analysis the students were 
able to complete in our short amount of time together. Much of their 
work became public-facing, either presented on the web (above), during 
our public electronic poster session at the end of the quarter, and 
through our [course blog](http://stanford-history.github.io/). We had a 
few fits and starts, mainly with getting up to speed on GitHub early on 
in the quarter, but by and large things felt like they went pretty 
smoothly.

I'm already spending time thinking about things I would change about the
course, and hope that I'll get a chance to teach the class again next
fall.

[^1]: The exception to this was the graduate students, who pursued research agendas in line with their own scholarly interests.
