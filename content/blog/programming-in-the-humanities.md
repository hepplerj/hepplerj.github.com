Over the course of my training as a digital historian, I have had two 
opportunities where classroom instruction involved learning a programming 
language. The first was in Prof. Stephen Ramsayâ€™s Electronic Text course 
during the fall of 2010 where I formally learned Ruby. The other was this past 
fall in a digital humanities seminar with Prof. William Thomas where I 
self-taught myself Objective-C in a month to build an iOS application.

I am, most broadly, interested in this idea of programming in the humanities 
as separate from Software Studies (Lev Manovich et al.), Critical Code Studies 
(Mark Marino et al.), and Platform Studies (Ian Bogost et al.) (hat tip to 
Steve Ramsay for pointing out this distinction to me recently). The digital 
humanities perspective on code is different, and perhaps this is an area for 
discussion.

I propose a general discussion about the nature and training of humanities 
programming:

* How do we help prepare graduate students and faculty in the basics of 
programming?
* Or, should they be concerned with programming at all (Steve [says 
yes](http://lenz.unl.edu/papers/2011/01/11/on-building.html))? Is it 
just nice to have, or essential? Is programming best left to the 
professionals?
* What are the benefits and pitfalls of taking the time to learn a programming 
language (or several)? How do you decide [which language is 
best](http://alexkehayias.tumblr.com/post/15125523657/learning-to-code-choosing-a-language)?
* How might programming knowledge shape careers?
* What mentoring services or formal instruction can be introduced to graduate 
training in humanities programming?
* How does building shape the way we think, research, teach (see [Kathi 
Berens](http://kathiiberens.com/2011/07/20/building-the-about-coding-changes-how-what-i-teach/), 
e.g.)?
* How failure produces results.
