title: Environmental History at the 2014 Western History Association Conference

I'm stealing an idea from my friend and fellow Husker Brenden Rensink. Brenden [just wrote a post](http://www.bwrensink.org/2014/07/15/borderlands-and-transnational-history-at-the-2014-western-history-association-conference/) summarizing borderlands and transnational history panels -- his area of study -- at the Western History Association Conference this year. I thought I'd do similar with environmental history.

To reiterate from Brenden's post, the Western History Association is [meeting in Newport Beach, California](http://westernhistoryassociation.wildapricot.org/event-697688), between October 15 to October 18 with the theme "The West & the World." Like Brenden, I'm listing any panel that includes some theme on environmental history even if that only includes a single paper. If I've missed a panel or paper, let me know on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jaheppler).

And of course, I would be remiss if I didn't point out digital history sessions. The Technology Committee, of which I am a part, is sponsoring another Six Shooters lightning session this year on Thursday 2:30pm-5pm. There's rumors of a cupcake reception afterwards. Presenters are limited to six minutes and six slides. We have some great speakers lined up already and we will be announcing them soon.

Finally, I am also chairing the panel "Western Encounters, Alliances, and Experiences: Mormons, Indians, and U.S. Federal Law" on Saturday, 8:30am-10:00am. The full program is [here](http://westernhistoryassociation.wildapricot.org/Resources/Documents/2014%20Program%20PDF%20for%20Website.pdf).

If you're going to be at the Western, get in touch and let's go grab coffee. Or the beach.
