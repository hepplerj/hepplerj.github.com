<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/01/eff-releases-report-detailing-fbi-intelligence">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>: "EFF has uncovered widespread violations stemming from FBI intelligence investigations from 2001 - 2008. In a report released today, EFF documents alarming trends in the Bureauâ€™s intelligence investigation practices, suggesting that FBI intelligence investigations have compromised the civil liberties of American citizens far more frequently, and to a greater extent, than was previously assumed."
