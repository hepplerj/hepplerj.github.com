Over the past few years I've been making changes to my technological life. It began a couple of years ago as I started to de-Google myself. Here's where things stand at the moment:

- Twitter has been deactivated for almost [two years to the day](https://jasonheppler.org/2022/11/19/0-tweets/). I spend some time on BlueSky, but I'm [pretty strict](https://social.jasonheppler.org/2024/11/08/becoming-newsresilient.html) about limiting myself there.
- I spend most of my social media-esque time at [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) for both short and longer-form posts. I've also started a second Micro.blog called [Tack & Ink](https://micro.blog/) designed to write about and share my current research project.
- [My newsletter](https://buttondown.email/jheppler) has fizzled out, but I'm thinking about ways I might come back to it. In the meantime, you could subscribe to the [Micro.blog newsletters](https://social.jasonheppler.org/subscribe/).
- As part of making myself [more news-resilient](https://social.jasonheppler.org/2024/11/08/becoming-newsresilient.html), I've shifted most of my news reading to print publications: _The Atlantic_, _The Economist_, and _High Country News_ are the primary sources, with the _Washington Post_ and _New York Times_ here and there. _The Economist_'s [The World in Brief](https://www.economist.com/the-world-in-brief) is particularly good.
- I'm moving a lot of my stuff out of the cloud. Dropbox has become increasingly less reliable, so I've been slowly moving my things to a local hard drive (which I can access on my local network anytime, or sync down to other machines using Syncthing). A few things are stored in Apple iCloud, but it's not a service I use much for file syncing.
- On services that have become unreliable, I'm also leaving 1Password for Apple Passwords. I don't quite understand what happened to 1Password, but its reliability, especially its integration in Safari, is incredibly inconsistent.
- I mentioned above my attempts to de-Google myself. A few years ago I migrated all of my email to Fastmail, which I'm very happy with. I also moved all of my calendars to Apple iCloud. This is also undergoing some change: after years as a Fantastical user, I'm going back to the stock Apple Calendar. It does everything I need and, while it has a little more friction than Fantastical, it works well. I pair Calendar with [Itsycal](https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/) for menu bar access.
- DuckDuckGo is my default search engine (again, the great Google decoupling).
- I'm still [solidly behind Obsidian](https://jasonheppler.org/2024/07/15/how-i-use-obsidian/) for note-taking.
