![Democratic candidate logos.](/assets/images/demlogos.png)

Between March 2019 and today, we've had [twenty-eight candidates](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/2020-presidential-candidates.html) for the Democratic nomination in the United States. I went through candidate websites and grabbed their primary logo, which I mostly find fascinating to see the moods that are conveyed by color and typography.^[I'll try and keep this updated if anyone else enters the race.]

By design alone, I think Buttigieg, Beto, and Castro have strong, memorable designs. Bennet and Buttigieg share similar vibes, Sanders's is a classic, Inslee's is somewhat forgettable (his later one was much better).
