This fall quarter I am teaching my digital history course. You can find the draft of the [syllabus here](http://jasonheppler.org/courses/dph.2016/). While the title of the course hasn't changed since the [last time I taught it](http://jasonheppler.org/teaching/hist205f.2014/), I've made two substantial changes to the overall structure of the course. First, the course focuses more heavily on *public* history instead of a range of digital methodologies. Part of this is self-serving---I've always wanted to teach a public history course, and the opportunity to combine *public* and *digital* was a welcome opportunity. 

The course remains motivated by my belief that it's easier to teach digital humanities when it's motivated by a scholarly question---in other words, teaching digital humanities in the abstract can be difficult to grasp, but seeing methods and frameworks applied in practice helps make things more concrete. The class, like last time, remains centered around the history of Silicon Valley in order to promote this way of learning by doing.

Second, I'm attempting to push the technology to the background a bit---to get students focused more on the *content* of their digital projects rather than its *form*. The form, in this case, is a new project I'm launching called *[Silicon Valley Historical](http://svhistorical.org)*, a [Cureatescape](http://curatescape.org) project for narrating spatial exhibits. Rather than doing shallow one-week dives into text analysis, mapping, or other analytical or visual tools, we'll spend the quarter mastering a tool and approach, which comes with all sorts of skills attached to it: digitization, metadata, project management, public history, spatial history. My hope is a greater focus on the historical content of the course and getting students into the Stanford University Archives.

It's still in draft stage, so excuse any missing links or drafty language. I'm still working on the graduate student supplementary syllabus, which should be up in the next week. A big shoutout to Sharon Leon, Trevor Owens, and Jim McGrath for sharing their syllabi with me as I designed this course. And a note of thanks for Caleb McDaniel's approach to a [rubric-centered syllabus](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/looking-back-on-backwards-survey.html), which I'm incorporating into this course.
