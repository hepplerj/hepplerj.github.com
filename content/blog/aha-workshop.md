Next Thursday I'll be teaching a workshop on network analysis for historians. You can find the schedule and material for the workshop [online](http://jasonheppler.org/projects/aha-workshop/). In addition to the workshop, I'll be part of the Digital History Table Talks lunch plenary and the digital drop-in session that afternoon. 

On Thursday afternoon, I'll be [chairing a panel](https://aha.confex.com/aha/2017/webprogram/Session15092.html) with [Brandon Locke](http://brandontlocke.com/), [Kalani Craig](http://www.kalanicraig.com/), and [Lauren Tilton](https://twitter.com/nolauren) on historical sources as data. Come check us out! 

And for a complete roundup of digital history sessions at this year's conference, Seth Denbo put together a [useful post](http://blog.historians.org/2016/12/digital-history-aha17/) detailing everything.
