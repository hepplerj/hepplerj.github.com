This weekend I'll be in New York for the American Historical
Association's annual meeting, where I'll be on two panels regarding
digital history. The first on January 3 is an experimental panel with several
scholars on using digital history in teaching and learning:

> **[Digital Pedagogy for History: Lightning Round](https://aha.confex.com/aha/2015/webprogram/Session12192.html)**  
> Using the "lightning round" method of spreading ideas in the digital
> humanities, this experimental panel features one-minute expositions on
> innovative projects and cool ideas in digital history for teaching and
> learning. Five or more panelists will be invited to register via
> Twitter at the meeting. Audience members will also be invited to join
> the lightning round.

The other on January 4 is a career-oriented roundtable with Jana Remy, Mills Kelly,
Andrew Torget, and Katina Rogers about tenure, alternative academic careers, and
graduate training:

> **[Digital Scholarship, Academic Careers, and Tenure](https://aha.confex.com/aha/2015/webprogram/Session12163.html)**  
> The digital revolution is disrupting long-established systems within
> the academy for tenure, promotion, and careers, offering both new
> opportunities and remarkable challenges for the next generation of
> historians. The AHA, in response, recently charged a committee to
> draft guidelines for evaluating digital scholarship in T&P. This
> roundtable will provide a ground-level discussion of the role of
> digital scholarship in early-career scholars, as session panelists
> share how digital scholarship fit into their work on the tenure clock,
> offered them alternative academic careers based on their digital
> projects, and the nature of peer review after the digital turn. They
> will also discuss how the MLAâ€™s publication of guidelines for
> evaluating digital scholarship could be applied to historians.

There are several digital panels at the AHA this year, many of
which I'll try to get to, as well as a THATCamp being [held on January
6th](http://aha2015.thatcamp.org/). Should be a great weekend!
