<a href="http://www.computedstyle.com/2010/12/hiring-front-end-engineers.html">Chris Zacharias</a>: "Artistically-minded individuals derive personal value from expressing themselves through their work. Consequently, they become much more entwined in what they create and its success. They are often emotionally tethered to the product and will surface gripes long before they echo back from your users. These types of web developers are nearly incapable of 'phoning it in' or letting something subpar slip through the cracks."
