Just a few updates on some data visualization work I've either been taking in or working on:

## Projects

- I [recently posted a map I created](http://jasonheppler.org/projects/western-lands/) some time ago in the aftermath of the Malheur occupation. It's similar to the map I [created in R](http://jasonheppler.org/2016/01/06/western-federal-lands-and-oregon/), but built in D3.js instead.
- Following the 2017 elections, [I created a simple interactive map and dumbbell chart](http://jasonheppler.org/projects/midwest-votes/) of midwestern votes for president. I don't think I ever advertised it on Twitter, so I'm noting it here. (And as I pointed out last week, I have a new interactive map up for [exploring Midwestern population change](http://jasonheppler.org/2017/06/06/mapping-midwest/).)

## Reading

- I really enjoyed [this data analysis by Quartz](https://qz.com/994486/the-way-you-draw-circles-says-a-lot-about-you/) based on Google's Quick, Draw! dataset. The analysis identifies how people from around the world draw a circle, and infer what it says about the drawer. 
- As usual, the *New York Times* has a [powerful scrollytelling piece](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/14/world/europe/migrant-rescue-efforts-deadly.html?_r=1) about migrants feeling Libya.

## Watching

- I recently watched Mike Bostock's [Open Viz keynote about d3.express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNbqfQlGkzc) and can highly recommend it. It's an interesting take on code editing and programming experiences. If you're new to D3.js, it's an exciting time to be getting involved. If you're already experienced in D3.js, it's exciting to see the changes that have come or are coming.
