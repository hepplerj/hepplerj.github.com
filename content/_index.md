## Hi, I'm Jason.

I am a historian of modern America studying the environment, cities, and politics, often using digital and computational tools. I am a developer-scholar at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](https://rrchnm.org/) and a member of the [Department of History and Art History](https://historyarthistory.gmu.edu) at George Mason University.
