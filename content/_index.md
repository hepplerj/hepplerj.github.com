## Writing

### Scholarship

I am currently completing a book tentatively titled *The Nature of the Valley: Silicon Valley and the Transformation of American Environmental Politics* for the University of Oklahoma Press.

My most recent book is *[Digital Community Engagement: Partnering Communities with the Academy](https://ucincinnatipress.manifoldapp.org/projects/digital-community-engagement)* (University of Cincinnati Press, 2020), which I co-edited with Rebecca Wingo and Paul Schadewald.

I have my hands in lots of projects around RRCHNM, but the ones that are most top-of-mind right now are [American Religious Ecologies](https://religiousecologies.org), [Death By Numbers](https://deathbynumbers.org), and [Mapping the University](https://rrchnm.org/mapping-the-university/).
