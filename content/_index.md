# ðŸ‘‹ Hi. I'm [Jason](/about/).

<img src="/assets/images/me.jpg" class="profile-photo" alt="Jason Heppler photo">

I am a historian of American environmentalism and the twentieth-century United States, with expertise in digital and computational historical methods. I am currently the [digital engagement librarian](http://library.unomaha.edu/) and [assistant professor of history](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-arts-and-sciences/history/index.php) at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, where I lead initiatives in digital humanities. Previously, I led digital history, data visualization, and humanities software design projects at Stanford University, and before that managed the [William F. Cody Digital Archive](http://codyarchive.org/). I'm also a founding member and co-lead of [Endangered Data Week](https://endangereddataweek.org), helping raise awareness around threats to publicly available data.


Preprints of my scholarship are available at my [Humanities Commons](https://hcommons.org/members/hepplerj/) page, and you can find a complete list on my [CV](https://jasonheppler.org/files/jah-cv.pdf).
