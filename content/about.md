## **Hi. I'm Jason Heppler**. I'm the digital engagement librarian at the [University of Nebraska at Omaha](http://library.unomaha.edu/), where I lead initiatives in digital humanities, data management, and data visualization.

Before joining the University of Nebraska at Omaha, I was an Academic Technology Specialist with the [Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research](http://cidr.stanford.edu) at Stanford University Libraries and a member of the research staff at the [Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis](http://cesta.stanford.edu) at Stanford University. Prior to Stanford, I was a project manager on the [William F. Cody Archive](http://codyarchive.org) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's [Center for Digital Research in the Humanities](http://cdrh.unl.edu). I remain a research affiliate with the [Spatial History Project](http://spatialhistory.stanford.edu) and [Humanities + Design](http://hdlab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University.

### Current Writing

I am currently completing my book *Suburban by Nature: Silicon Valley and the Transformation of American Environmental Politics*, under contract with the University of Oklahoma Press as part of their new Environment in Modern North America series. Few places symbolize the twentieth century like Silicon Valley. Stretching from the communities of San Jose to Palo Alto, the dense suburban region is home to nation's high tech industrial corridor. 

In my book, I re-imagine the Silicon Valley's history not just as symbol of post-industrialism, but as an illustrative of the consequences of the post-war period's uneven suburban growth in shaping 20th century environmental politics, concerns over social justice, and ideas of sustainability. I complicate the now familiar story of suburbanization's rapid transformation of post-war American cities by explaining how local activists linked social and environmental issues in creating a new form of politics. In doing so, I help place current debates over sustainability into a deeper historical context and problematize the post-war environmental movement as at once a movement of the white middle class, which gave rise to environmental and social justice movements of the latter half of the 20th century.

### Open Data Advocacy

I am committed to open data advocacy to improve transparency and access to information, from promoting open research practices to open government data. I'm active in communities advancing open research including [Mozilla Open Leadership](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/) and [Data for Democracy](ttp://datafordemocracy.org).

I am an open project lead and founding member of [Endangered Data Week](http://endangereddataweek.org), an annual event to promote a culture of data consciousness by creating training materials, guidelines, and resources to advocate for open data and promote awareness around threats to publicly available data. If you'd like to get involved, [let us know](http://github.com/endangereddataweek/resources/)!

### Cycling Advocacy and Urban Sustainability

I'm an urban planning and transportation nerd. I work on bicycle advocacy projects both on campus and in the Omaha community with amazing partners like [Omaha Bikes](https://omahabikes.org/), the [Omaha Bike Network](http://livewellomaha.org/), and [Mode Shift Omaha](https://modeshiftomaha.org/). My work on sustainability at the University of Nebraska at Omaha includes chairing the Triple Bottom Line Committee for UNO Libraries, where we are focused on building a community that is economically sound, environmentally responsible, and socially just.

### Can we meet for coffee? 

I'll make an effort to meet with anyone who reaches out, but in advance: I won't tweet about your project, you can't use me in your marketing, and I'm not investing in anything. All I have on offer is to listen to your story and offer advice if I have any to give. 

You can write great emails by following [this advice from Jason Freedman](http://humbledmba.com/how-to-email-busy-people):

> If you want a meeting, ask for a meeting. Provide some time options and ask for a specified length. If you want an introduction, ask for an introduction. If you're looking for funding, tell him you're currently fundraising and ask to meet to show him your pitch. Don't be sly. Don't hint. Make the process ridiculously easy by just asking for what you want.

### Privacy

I take your privacy seriously. I have installed a local analytics package called [Matomo](https://matomo.org/), which interprets information your browser already sends (like IP address, screen resolution, browser, and operating system.) This information is regularly flushed, kept anonymous, and password-protected. I take precautions to ensure no one else sees this information, either. If you're running Do Not Track on your browser, Matomo won't track you. 

If you email me something I keep that anonymous, especially when sent encrypted. If I decide I would like to quote something from your email, I will ask you first. If you've emailed me about something I got wrong, I may use your name to credit the correction but I won't if it's not public information. [Here's my public key](https://jasonheppler.org/jasonheppler.asc). I'm also `jaheppler` on Keybase.

Please [email me](mailto:jason@jasonheppler.org) if you have any questions.
