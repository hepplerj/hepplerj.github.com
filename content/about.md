<p class="u-lead"><strong>Hi, I'm Jason!</strong> I'm the digital engagement librarian and assistant professor of history at the <a href="http://library.unomaha.edu/">University of Nebraska at Omaha</a>, where I lead initiatives in digital humanities, data services, and data visualization.</p>

🌽 I live in [Omaha, Nebraska](https://jasonheppler.org/2016/09/22/homecoming/), with my wife, two kids, and two dogs. (We dream of settling in Colorado.)

💻 I work at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, where I lead initiatives in digital humanities and data science for UNO Libraries. In the [past](https://linkedin.com/in/jasonheppler/), I've worked at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Stanford University.

🏞 I volunteer with the [ Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/), [Mode Shift Omaha](https://modeshiftomaha.org), [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/), and the Environmental History Action Collaborative with the [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative](https://envirodatagov.org).

☀️ I grew up in Mitchell, South Dakota.

## Open Data Advocacy

I am committed to open data advocacy to improve transparency and access to information, from promoting open research practices to open government data. I'm active in communities advancing open research including [Mozilla Open Leadership](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/) and [Data for Democracy](ttp://datafordemocracy.org).

I am an open project lead and founding member of [Endangered Data Week](http://endangereddataweek.org), an annual event to promote a culture of data consciousness by creating training materials, guidelines, and resources to advocate for open data and promote awareness around threats to publicly available data. If you'd like to get involved, [let us know](http://github.com/endangereddataweek/resources/)!

## Cycling Advocacy and Urban Sustainability

I'm an urban planning and transportation nerd. I work on bicycle advocacy projects both on campus and in the Omaha community with amazing partners like [Omaha Bikes](https://omahabikes.org/), the [Omaha Bike Network](http://livewellomaha.org/), and [Mode Shift Omaha](https://modeshiftomaha.org/). My work on sustainability at the University of Nebraska at Omaha includes chairing the Triple Bottom Line Committee for UNO Libraries, where we are focused on building a community that is economically sound, environmentally responsible, and socially just, and serving as a member of the Sustainability Curriculum Committee. I'm also a member of the Environmental History Action Collaborative with the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative, where we seek to bring historical perspective to present-day environmental debates.

## Can we meet for coffee?

I'll make an effort to meet with anyone who reaches out, but in advance: I won't tweet about your project, you can't use me in your marketing, and I'm not investing in anything. All I have on offer is to listen to your story and offer advice if I have any to give. 

You can write great emails by following [this advice from Jason Freedman](http://humbledmba.com/how-to-email-busy-people):

> If you want a meeting, ask for a meeting. Provide some time options and ask for a specified length. If you want an introduction, ask for an introduction. If you're looking for funding, tell him you're currently fundraising and ask to meet to show him your pitch. Don't be sly. Don't hint. Make the process ridiculously easy by just asking for what you want.

## Privacy

I take your privacy seriously. I have installed a local analytics package called [Matomo](https://matomo.org/), which interprets information your browser already sends (like IP address, screen resolution, browser, and operating system.) This information is regularly flushed, kept anonymous, and password-protected. I take precautions to ensure no one else sees this information, either. If you're running Do Not Track on your browser, Matomo won't track you. 

If you email me something I keep that anonymous, especially when sent encrypted. If I decide I would like to quote something from your email, I will ask you first. If you've emailed me about something I got wrong, I may use your name to credit the correction but I won't if it's not public information. [Here's my public key](https://jasonheppler.org/jasonheppler.asc). I'm also `jaheppler` on Keybase.

Please [email me](mailto:jason@jasonheppler.org) if you have any questions.
