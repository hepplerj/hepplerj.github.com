*Becoming* is the best of memoirs. The Obamas have a reputation for their intelligence, ability, and decency, and it shines clearly through Michelle Obama's story. It's very well-written---something you can't say about many memoirs. This is the sort of book that should be widely available because it, like Michelle Obama itself, will change the world for the better.
