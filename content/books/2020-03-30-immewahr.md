Think of a map of the United States. You probably pictured this one.

But this map, what Daniel Immewehr argues is our **logo map**, doesn't really capture the United States. For the US is larger in its territorial collection: Alaska and Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and tiny Pacific islands, Guantanamo in Cuba, and, at one time, the Philippines. The country is much larger in extent than we popularly imagine, and these overseas territories are essential in the US's rise to power.
