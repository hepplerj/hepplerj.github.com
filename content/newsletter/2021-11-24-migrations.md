Hi.

If you’re reading this, it means you signed up for Breve sometime in the past year. I was doing this over at Substack, but as of today I’ve migrated over to Buttondown.

The good news is nothing changes on your end — whatever email you chose to sign up with over at Substack will be the one I’m also using at Buttondown. Which also means: if you no longer want to receive this newsletter it’s super obvious how to opt-out at the bottom of this email. No worries if you do. Godspeed.

If you’ve made it this far, I assume that means you’re sticking around. Expect more or less the same here as the previous issues: infrequent, brief (as the name implies), and hopefully interesting. I promise not to be a burden on your inbox.

Glad you’re here.
