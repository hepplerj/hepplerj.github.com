[Heather Kelly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/08/05/trump-post-removed-facebook/) in the *Washington Post*:

> Facebook and Twitter on Wednesday took extraordinary action against President Trump for spreading coronavirus misinformation after his official and campaign accounts broke their rules, respectively.
  
> Facebook removed from Trump's official account the post of a video clip from a Fox News interview in which he said children are “almost immune” from covid-19. Twitter required his Team Trump campaign account to delete a tweet with the same video, blocking it from tweeting in the interim.

> In the removed video, President Trump can be heard in a phone interview saying schools should open. He goes on to say, "If you look at children, children are almost — and I would almost say definitely — but almost immune from this disease," and that they have stronger immune systems.

The [source video, however, is still on YouTube](https://twitter.com/evelyndouek/status/1291181500709380103). It's [simply not true](https://hms.harvard.edu/news/covid-19-children) that children are immune from the disease, nor should we forget that there are children *and* adults in schools.
