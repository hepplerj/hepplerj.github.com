Last week, as part of the Environmental History Action Collaborative of [EDGI](https://envirodatagov.org/) I collaborated with Jay Turner, Scout Blum, Finis Dunaway, Emily Pawley, Keith Pluymers, and Ryan Driskell Tate on [annotating Biden's clean energy plan](https://envirodatagov.org/joe-bidens-clean-energy-plan-speech-annotated/). Our annotations add historical context, fact-checks, and comparisons between his plan and the Green New Deal.
