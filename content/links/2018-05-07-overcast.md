Marco Arment [introducing Overcast 4.2](https://marco.org/2018/04/27/overcast42):

> In Overcast 4.2, the login screen now prominently encourages anonymous accounts by default.
>
> If you already have an account in iCloud, itâ€™ll pop up a dialog box over this screen asking if you want to use it.
>
> And the first time you launch 4.2, people with email-based accounts will be encouraged to migrate them to anonymous accounts.

How often do you get an update to an app that asks for *less* information from
you? I've been an Overcast user since it launched, and Marco's commitment to
this kind of thing adds to my desire to keep supporting his work for a long time.
