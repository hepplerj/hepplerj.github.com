I've been remiss in pointing out that my buddy Elijah Meeks' *D3 in
Action* has appeared in print. I've been getting chapters of the book
through [Manning's early digital access](http://manning.com/about/meap)
for the last few months that he's worked on the book and can say that
it's an excellent introduction to D3. If you're looking to get started
with the library and, more importantly, how you can use visualization in
the humanities effectively, you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy.
