I am very excited to see the public release of 
[Topotime](http://dh.stanford.edu/topotime/), a data model, d3.js 
layout, and Python function for representing complex or fuzzy time. My 
colleagues Elijah Meeks and Karl Grossner have been working on Topotime for the 
last few months and I have been eagerly looking forward to its public release.
