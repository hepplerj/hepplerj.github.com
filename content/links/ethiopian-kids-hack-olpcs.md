[Evan Ackerman writes about the introduction of tablet computers](http://dvice.com/archives/2012/10/ethiopian-kids.php) to Ethiopian children with no formal education:

> What happens if you give a thousand Motorola Zoom tablet PCs to Ethiopian kids who have never even seen a printed word? Within five months, theyâ€™ll start teaching themselves English while circumventing the security on your OS to customize settings and activate disabled hardware. Whoa.
