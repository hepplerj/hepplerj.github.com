[Gary Wills](https://www.nybooks.com/online/2012/12/15/our-moloch/): 

> We guarantee that crazed man after crazed man will have a flood of killing power readily supplied him. We have to make that offering, out of devotion to our Moloch, our god. The gun is our Moloch. We sacrifice children to him daily.
