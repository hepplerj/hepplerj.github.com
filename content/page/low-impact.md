<h1 class="manifesto">Low <span>Impact</span> Website</h1>

This is a low-impact website. The internet is dirty: it requires electricity, which in turn generates carbon emissions contributing to climate change. The Internet is responsible for [3.7% of the world's carbon emissions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/aug/12/carbon-footprint-internet) due to the amount of electricity required to run data transfer centers around the world.

My goal here is to create a light-weight website that reduces data transfer. To achieve this, it follows the following principles: 

1. Does not load any images before they are actively requested by the user.
2. Minimizes the power consumption on the users device.
3. Informs the user of the impact of their browsing behavior.
4. Does not make use of videos.
5. Stores data locally on the userâ€™s device to minimize data transfer.
6. Compresses all data to the greatest extent possible.
7. Loads only the most crucial programming scripts, frameworks and cookies.
8. Limits the amount of light emitted by the screen.
9. Optimizes and limits the use of custom fonts.

    <p>This page uses ~<strong>3.8kb</strong> of data. You've generated around <strong>0.31g</strong> of CO2 by visiting.</p>

  <div class="metrics-right">
    <p>If this website received 10,000 visitors per month (far, far less than I usually get even in a year) that'd be the equivalent of 37.06kg of CO2. That's about as much CO2 as boiling 5,022 cups of coffee. Put another way, this website emits the amount of carbon that a single tree absorbs in a year.</p>

While we can take individual steps to reduce our own impact on the planet,
don't mistake our individual consumer choices as an [overall solution to the
climate
crisis](https://ourworldindata.org/how-much-will-it-cost-to-mitigate-climate-change). It is imperative that we [hold companies accountable](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change).
