This page briefly describes what I am currently working on, or at least, the main things that I am trying to focus my attention on over the short term.

**November:**

- Jumping back into D3.js and catching back up on modern JavaScript, which I'm doing through [Observable notebooks](https://observablehq.com/@hepplerj).
- Wrapping up (ðŸ¤ž) book edits and sending it off to the press for review.

**Spring semester:**

- Teaching "[BootcampR: An Introduction to R](/courses/bootcampr.2020/)."
