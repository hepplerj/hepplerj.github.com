You can find my shorter posts, links, and photos at [writing.jasonheppler.org](https://writing.jasonheppler.org). I'm usually [on micro.blog](https://micro.blog/jaheppler), which I recommend as an alternative to Twitter, Instagram, and other centrally hosted social media platforms. I'm no longer actively on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jaheppler), but you can sometimes find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jasonheppler.org) and [Mastodon](https://historians.social/@jaheppler).
