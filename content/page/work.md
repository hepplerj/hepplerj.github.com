I’m looking at new roles and would love to chat about different projects, roles, and ideas.

**Who am I?** I served as the Academic Technology Specialist at Stanford University and the Digital Engagement Librarian at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I've created web applications, lead teams, and set standards. I've also written copy for websites, wrangled servers, and cleaned the dishes in the shared kitchen. 

**What I’m looking for**: Unusual roles at larger companies or academia, or advisor or cofounder discussions are all interesting. I’m enthusiastic about work in the domains of climate, cities, education, programming, and more.

**What matters to me**: I love teams with values, vision, and diversity. I like strong writing culture and a balance between pragmatism and theory.

**Also**: I’m spending some time on volunteer and open source projects, and am interested in focused, effective activism projects.
