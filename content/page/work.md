I'm not currently looking for a new role. But I'm always happy to chat about different projects, roles, and ideas.

**Who am I?** I served as the Academic Technology Specialist at Stanford University and the Digital Engagement Librarian at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I've created web applications, lead teams, and set standards. I am currently the senior developer at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](https://rrchnm.org). I've also written copy for websites, wrangled servers, and cleaned the dishes in the shared kitchen. 

**What I'm looking for**: Unusual roles at larger companies or academia, or advisor or cofounder discussions are all interesting. I'm enthusiastic about work in the domains of climate change, cities, education, and more.

**What matters to me**: I love teams with values, vision, and diversity. I like strong writing culture and a balance between pragmatism and theory.

**Also**: I'm spending some time on volunteer and open source projects, and am interested in focused, effective activism projects.
