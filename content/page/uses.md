A page detailing my personal computing environment, inspired by [usesthis.com](https://usesthis.com/) and [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/). Updated December 9, 2024.

- **Computer**:
  - Personal: 13" MacBook Air (2020) with the M1 chip. Fantastic machine and probably my favorite laptop I've ever owned.
  - Work: 14" MacBook Pro M2 (2023) with the M2 chip. A real workhorse of a machine.
  - iPad Air, green (2019): For those times when I don't want to pack a whole laptop. A surprisingly useful machine, but also a major consumption device for TV/movies.
- **Mouse**: I'm still rolling the Magic Mouse but am considering an upgrade to the Humanscale Pro Click.
- **Keyboard**: [Keychron Q1 QMK Custom Mechanical Keyboard](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q1). Paired with the knob and in shell white. It's such a great keyboard.
- **Headphones**: Apple AirPod Pro. The noise cancelling is fantastic.
- **Editor**: [neovim](https://neovim.io/) with [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/).
- **Browser**: Safari, or [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/).
- **Terminal**: [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/). It's fast.
- **Reading**: [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) for RSS, Instapaper for read-it-later, Apple Books for the very few ebooks I buy, and [physical books](https://writing.jasonheppler.org/2023/07/10/office-coming-together/).
- **Email**: [Fastmail](https://ref.fm/u25471400) (referral link). I made a concerted move way from Google in the last few years, and Fastmail is a great email provider.
- **Writing and Notes Management**: [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md). This app, paired with a few plugins, ticks all the boxes for the kind of research and writing software I've been looking for. I'm also a fan of [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview) for getting the writing done. I think the only suitable replacement at this point would be going all-in on [org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com).
