If you are a student, GRA, or project collaborator at George Mason University, you are always welcome to come talk with me in office hours. Please do so by booking an appointment, since booking an appointment will make sure we both know exactly when we will meet.

**Remote office hours.** Since I work remotely for RRCHNM, I will not be physically in a campus office except for on-site visits a few times a year. You will need to book an appointment with me using the link below and we will meet over Zoom. If this is your first time using Zoom, you'll need to install the software if you haven't done so already. When you join the call, you'll be automatically placed into the waiting room and I will let you in.
