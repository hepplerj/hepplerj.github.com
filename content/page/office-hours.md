If you are a student or a GRA at UNO, you are always welcome to come talk with me in office hours. Please do so by booking an appointment, since booking an appointment will make sure we both know exactly when we will meet.

**Remote office hours during the pandemic.** I will not be physically in my office for the duration of the pandemic. You will need to book an appointment with me using the link below and we will meet over Zoom. If this is your first time using Zoom, you'll need to install the software if you haven't done so already. When you join the call, you'll be automatically placed into the waiting room and I will let you in.

**Booking an appointment.** You can browser through the dates and times I have available at my [booking page](https://libcal.unomaha.edu/appointments/crisslibrary). If the times that I have available do not work for you, please [email me](mailto:jheppler@unomaha.edu) and suggest three days and times that work for you.
