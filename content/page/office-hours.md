If you are a student or a GRA at UNO, you are always welcome to come talk with me in office hours. Please do so by booking an appointment, since booking an appointment will make sure we both know exactly when we will meet.

**Where.** My office is Criss Library 215, located on Dodge Campus. Please ask for me at the service desk on the main floor of the library.

**Booking an appointment.** You can browser through the dates and times I have available at my [booking page](https://libcal.unomaha.edu/appointments/crisslibrary). If the times that I have available do not work for you, please [email me](mailto:jheppler@unomaha.edu) and suggest three times that work for you.
