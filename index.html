<h2 intro="">Hi. I'm Jason.</h2>

<p>I'm a writer, historian, hacker-scholar, and tech enthusiast. I grew up in South Dakota and currently live in Lincoln, Nebraska, with my wife and our two dogs.</p>

<p>I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln specializing in the North American West, 20th century United States, and digital history. My dissertation research is on the Cold War American West and digital computers as it centered around the military-industrial-academic complex in the region.</p>

<p>In January 2011 I became project manager for the William F. Cody Digital Archive at the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities. Through a multi-institutional partnership, the Cody Archive seeks to contextualizes the life and times of William F. "Buffalo Bill" Cody.</p>

<p>Prior to joining CDRH I served as both research and teaching assistant for the History Department. I worked on or created several projects, including The Digital History Project, Railroads and the Making of Modern America, The Buffalo Bill Project, Buffalo Bill's Wild West and the Progressive Image of American Indians, and Framing Red Power. More academic information can be found in my curriculum vitae.</p>

<p>As a bit of a hobby, I am interested in programming and the development of programming languages. In 2011 I wrote an ebook called The Rubyist Historian intending to introduce humanities scholars to the basics of the Ruby programming language and its application to their everyday work.</p>

<p>Outside of technology, my interests are music, geeking out over coffee, and playing guitar. In my free time I read fiction and watch films. My music interests range from bebop jazz to indie rock. I have a strong interest in Theravada Buddhism and Vipassana meditation (although I do not consider myself a Buddhist yet).</p>

<h2>The Site</h2>

<p>I write on a range of topics. Although I generally write on digital history and technology, my posts range from culture, music, coffee, ideas, travel, and anything else that strikes me. There is no schedule or length that I seek to meet.</p>

<p>The site originally ran on WordPress but moved to Github and Jekyll for static blogging in 2010. My posts are now version controlled with git. Most of my writing and coding happens in Sublime Text 2 on my MacBook Pro. The design of this site has changed frequently, mainly because I enjoy tinkering.</p>

<h2>Elsewhere</h2>

<p>I am scattered around the Internet:</p>

<li>Academia.edu</li>
<li>Github</li>
<li>Last.fm</li>
