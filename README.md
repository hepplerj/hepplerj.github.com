# JasonHeppler.org  Site Source

This repository contains the source for my personal site at 
[http://jasonheppler.org](http://jasonheppler.org). The site runs on 
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). 

# Terms of Use

I'm more than pleased if you wish to borrow from my design but please be sure 
that *content* (anything inside `_posts` or `pages`, etc) is removed before you 
launch your site. If you don't understand it or didn't write it, remove it. 
Test everything locally before uploading your site.

Thanks!
