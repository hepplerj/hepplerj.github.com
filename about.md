**Hi. I'm Jason.**

I am a 20th century U.S. historian specializing in environmental, the North American West, and digital and public history. I am a fourth generation westerner and grew up in South Dakota, where I spent a lot of time in the outdoors and reading books. I currently live in San Jose, California, with my wife and our two dogs.

I am the Academic Technology Specialist in the [Department of History](http://history.stanford.edu) at [Stanford University](http://stanford.edu), where I collaborate with faculty and graduate students on innovative approaches to technology in their teaching and research.

Additionally, I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [History](http://history.unl.edu) at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](http://unl.edu) specializing in the North American West, 20th century United States, and digital history. My dissertation research focuses on an urban and environmental history of Silicon Valley.

Prior to joining Stanford, I served as the project manager for the [William F. Cody Digital Archive](http://codyarchive.org) at the [Center for Digital Research in the Humanities](http://cdrh.unl.edu) on the campus of UNL. I have contributed to several digital history projects, including [The Digital History Project](http://digitalhistory.unl.edu), [Railroads and the Making of Modern America](http://railroads.unl.edu), [The Buffalo Bill Project](http://buffalobillproject.unl.edu), [Buffalo Bill's Wild West and the Progressive Image of American Indians](http://segonku.unl.edu/~jheppler/showindian/), and [Framing Red Power](http://framingredpower.org). More academic information can be found in my [curriculum vitae](http://jasonheppler.org/jah-vita.pdf).

As a bit of a work-related hobby and productive procrastination, I am interested in programming and the history of programming languages. In 2011 I wrote an ebook called [The Rubyist Historian](http://hepplerj.github.com/rubyist-historian/) that intended to introduce humanities scholars to the basics of the Ruby programming language and its application to their everyday work. I am currently working on porting [The Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/) over to Ruby. In addition to Ruby, I spend my days working with Bash, PHP, and Python, and have dabbled with Objective-C.

## About Here

I write on a range of topics. Although I generally write on digital history and technology, my posts range from culture, music, coffee, ideas, and anything else that strikes me. There is no schedule or length that I seek to meet.

The site originally ran on WordPress but moved to [Github](https://github.com) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) for static blogging in early 2011. My posts are now version controlled with git. Most of my writing and coding happens in [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) or vim on my MacBook Pro. I use to be a heavy TextMate user, but remain unsure about it's future. The design of this site has changed frequently, mainly because I enjoy tinkering.
