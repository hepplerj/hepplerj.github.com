### Programming in the Humanities

[THATCamp American Historical Association 
2012](http://aha2012.thatcamp.org/01/04/session-proposal-programming-in-the-humanities/), Chicago, IL, January 2012

> Over the course of my training as a digital historian, I have had two 
> opportunities where classroom instruction involved learning a programming 
> language. The first was in Prof. Stephen Ramsayâ€™s Electronic Text course 
> during the fall of 2010 where I formally learned Ruby. The other was this 
> past fall in a digital humanities seminar with Prof. William Thomas where I 
> self-taught myself Objective-C in a month to build an iOS application.
> 
> I am, most broadly, interested in this idea of programming in the humanities 
> as separate from Software Studies (Lev Manovich et al.), Critical Code 
> Studies (Mark Marino et al.), and Platform Studies (Ian Bogost et al.) (hat 
> tip to Steve Ramsay for pointing out this distinction to me recently). The 
> digital humanities perspective on code is different, and perhaps this is an 
> area for discussion.
