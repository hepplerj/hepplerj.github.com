A few nights ago Lincoln Mullen mentioned on Twitter his admiration for Drafts, Agile Tortoise's iPhone notes app. The premise of Drafts is simple: write thing down. When you launch the app, you're presented with a blank note and keyboard ready for your input. You also have the option to send the content of your note to various other iOS apps, including OmniFocus, Tweetbot, Dropbox, Mail, and many others.

Drafts has taken enough prominence in my workflow that it has been given the privileged spot on my iPhone's dock. For 99Â¢, you can't go wrong.
