I’ve been thinking about .....

The first history article to be published as born-digital was Philip Ethington’s [Los Angeles and the Problem of Urban Historical Knowledge](http://cwis.usc.edu/dept/LAS/history/historylab/LAPUHK/index.html). Published in 2000 by the American Historical Review, the project ostensibly served as a launching point for the AHR to explore the digital medium. The cover of that year’s AHR included a screen grab from Ethington’s project and a review essay titled “Historicizing the City of Angels” that included pieces by Robert Schneider, Michael Engh, and Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch.

Despite it’s apparent prominence, appearing on the cover of the journal, Ethington’s project does not appear in the table of contents. The introduction to the review essays mentions a “multimedia text” by Ethington “that includes digitized animated maps and other materials, as well as an essay on epistemology and the history of urban centers.”[^1] But otherwise, readers have no indication that this digital journal exists. It’s not apparent in the contents, only by a brief mention in the introduction and an ambiguous screenshot on the cover. Ethington’s name is not part of the table of contents.[^2]

Three years later, William Thomas and Edward Ayers was asked by the AHR to write a born-digital piece about their project, The Valley of the Shadow.[^3] Interesting problems abounded with the publication of that work as well. As Thomas has written [elsewhere](), there was a disconnect between the print summary of the digital article and the article itself. Readers were apparently oblivious to the existience of the digital article, which contained the real weight of the argument being made by Thomas and Ayers. 

Two years after that, Jack Censer and Lynn Hunt published [Imaging the French Revolution: Depictions of the French Revolutionary Crowd](http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/imaging/home.html) in February 2005. Through a partnership with the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media, the AHR ....

Since the publication of Censer and Hunt’s article, there have been no new digital publications that have received the AHR’s stamp of approval. The only substantial movement towards the promotion of digital publishing in the last eight years for the AHR has been the announcement of the [AHR’s prize in digital history](http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/2012/1202/Call-for-Submissions-for-the-AHR-Prize.cfm).

My point here isn’t to beat up on the American Historical Review or the AHA. Rather, I wanted to trace the early evolution of born digital history publishing. The AHA, as the largest organization of American historians in the United States and lead publisher in cutting edge academic research, serves as a decent barometer for looking at how historians -- and publishers -- have addressed digital work. 

The trend seems to be moving yet another direction -- instead of born digital only, the movement is heading towards a hybrid of print and digital. Ed Ayers is perhaps the originator in the profession, having published *In the Presence of Mine Enemies* in {{year}} that drew heavily from the Valley project. William Thomas and Richard White have both published new books almost simultaneously about the railroad in the nineteenth century US. Not only were both books picked up by large publishers they both include substantial digital history projects behind them (Railroads and the Making of Modern America and The Spatial History Project, respectively).

We might be on the emergence of a trend in digital work. Graduate students speak about writing traditional dissertations and developing digital work alongside it. Others I’ve spoken to who are working on digital work are pursuing a similar strategy in the creation and dissemination of their scholarship. 

The prevalence of print and digital says something about our culture in academia. The culture won't change overnight, and in some ways we can applaud digital work in driving the creation of innovative research, raising new questions, and uncovering new insights. But digital publishing hasn't tackled with the biggest problem: how to make digital work count.

Hundreds of hours are poured into academic research by a single scholar. The end result is a stack of paper sandwiched between cardboard, which underwent a long process of review, editing, proofing, research,
