<h1>Framing Red Power: Newspapers and the Trail of Broken Treaties</h1>

<p>Commentators, participants, and historians have suggested connections  between the media and the political movements of the 1960s and their  interactions that allowed activists to communicate their agendas. By  utilizing media coverage of the Trail of Broken Treaties and ensuing  occupation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1972 by the American  Indian Movement, Indian activists secured a medium in which to voice  their goals.  The study of the relationship between mass media and the  protest movements is important, historian Julia Bond has argued, because  “until historians unravel the complex links between the southern  freedom struggle and the mass media, their understanding of how the  Movement functioned, why it succeeded, and when and where it failed,  will be incomplete.&#8221;  Bond’s declaration can be extended to other  movements of the 1960s and 1970s that utilized mass media to their  advantage.</p>

<p>The American Indian Movement forcefully inserted their agenda into  public discourse and used the print medium to insert their voice into  public policy debates.  What sort of things were activists talking to  the media about?  What was the media reporting?  Omitting?  What was  AIM&#8217;s message?  Did the media report the demonstrator&#8217;s goals or was the  message lost in the sensationalism of the occupation?  Was the  occupation of the BIA a successful strategy for disseminating their  agenda?  <em><a href="http://segonku.unl.edu/~jheppler/index.html" target="_blank">Framing  Red Power</a></em> analyzes the ways newspapers covered the American  Indian Movement by bringing together digital technologies and  traditional historiographical methodologies, allowing historians to pose  new questions about the interaction between media sources and political  actors.</p>

<p><img title="More..." src="http://tdhxp.wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" />My first  decision in the planning process of the project was an editorial  constraint: what sort of print sources would I include in the digital  scholarship?  I made the decision to focus on major newspapers at the  national (<em>New York Times</em> and <em>Washington Post</em>), regional (<em>Minneapolis  Tribune</em> and <em>Chicago Tribune</em>), and local (<em>Argus Leader</em> and <em>Rapid City Journal</em>) level.  I began compiling my sources by  searching online digital repositories like ProQuest and hunting down  microfilm sources for anything not digitized.  Once the primary sources  were located, I began the process of transcription and &#8220;mark up&#8221; with  eXtensible Markup Language (XML), a method of encoding documents with  specific information.</p>

<p>With a corpus of digitized newspaper articles, next came the process  of integrating digital tools that assist historians in analyzing  material.  Digital technologies are not an end in and of themselves but  rather a method for querying and analyzing material in new ways.  Since  my purpose was to analyze text and language, I turned to textual  analysis tools like Wordle (though I hope in the near future to  integrate <a href="http://libtextcenter.unl.edu/cocoon/cdrh/tokenx/index.html?file=../xml/base.xml" target="_blank">TokenX</a>, a powerful textual analysis tool developed  by Brian Pytlik-Zillig at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, into my  project to provide more penetrating and interactive analysis of the  articles).  With Wordle, I developed visual representations of the  newspaper articles that allowed me to spot recurring themes in the text.</p>

<p>Collectively, the newspaper articles appear to focus on Indians, the  BIA building, and the federal government far more than they focus on  what the activists have to say or why they are in Washington  demonstrating.  The issues that AIM wanted to call attention to during  the demonstration, such as treaty rights or tribal government, are lost  in a narrative more interested in the federal response.  To prevent  skewed results in the word cloud, certain phrases have been strung  together.  For example, the &#8220;Indian&#8221; in American Indian Movement is not  read by the program as an individual word but rather as part of a  phrase.  The same is true for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Trail of  Broken Treaties, and several other phrases.</p>

<p>The ability to analyze sources with digital technologies allows  historians to ask new questions of historical events.  Tools like word  clouds help to highlight the frequency of language in text, a process  impossible (or nearly so) to achieve in print, and reveal ways we can  visualize narratives and analyze their significance.</p>
