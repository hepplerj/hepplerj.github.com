<h1>Liveblogging the Rawley: The Historical Community Online</h1>

<p>Today, the UNL History Graduate Students&#8217; Association is hosting the  Third Annual James Rawley Conference in the Humanities.  The panel  coming up is entitled &#8220;The Historical Community Online: Using Digital  Tools to Interpret the Past,&#8221; which features my colleague, Brent.  More  below the jump.</p>

<p>10:31 am - Our colleague Leslie Working introduces everyone.  The  panel is addressing the ways academic communities face change and are  adapting.  Speaking first is Susannah Hall, a senior in History and  Chemistry who has done a lot of work on the UNL science department.  A  winner of numerous awards, among them the UNL Undergrad Chemistry Award.   Also on the Deans List multiple years.  Brent Rogers received his MA  in public history from Cal State in Sacramento.  He&#8217;s also received  several awards for his work. He works as a TA at UNL, and has done  notable work on the UNL Digital History site.  He will be discussing  digital change in the historical community.  Commenting will be Dr. Doug  Seefeldt, Assistant Professor in History at UNL who received his  doctorate from Arizona State.  He has written and edited several  articles and digital projects, most recently the<a href="http://jeffersonswest.unl.edu/archive/index.php"> Thomas  Jefferson project</a>.  He is currently working on a project about the <a href="http://mountainmeadows.unl.edu/index.html">Mountain Meadow&#8217;s  Massacre</a>.</p>

<p>10:34 am - Susannah is up first after some minor technical  difficulties.  So much for &#8220;smart&#8221; classrooms&#8230;</p>

<p>10:35 am - Dr. Seefeldt saves the day!</p>

<p>10:37 - Scientific coursework defines the direction of the university  in the nineteenth century.  The building of a scientific community  aided in providing the university respect and accreditation.</p>

<p>10:39 - The Botanical Seminar assisted in developing a community at  UNL.</p>

<p>10:41 - Botanical Survey of Nebraska, 1899.  Collected specimens for  verification, and early specimens still remain.</p>

<p>10:42 - 1886, expanded programs.  Course on animal disease.  Helped  establish entomology and ornithology departments.  Sem Bot fostered a  tighter community at UNL as students continued joining, including both  undergrads and grads.</p>

<p>10:54 - Brent&#8217;s talk is entitled &#8220;The Historical Community and the  Digital Future.&#8221;  He tells me he will post the talk online, so watch the  blog for an update.</p>

<p>10:55 - Tools like databases, interactive maps, databases, and  textual analysis has changed the way we write and present the past.</p>

<p>10:56 - &#8220;Maintaining and preserving the records in this digital age.&#8221;</p>

<p>10:56 - More and more people turn to the web for information, drawing  their own connections between information.  Digital tools help navigate  the web and open new windows of discovery and tap human curiosity.</p>

<p>10:57 - In age of &#8220;media saturation,&#8221; students expect digital media  in the classroom.  Students expect nonlinear presentations of the past  and expect to engage the past through interactive medium rather than  absorbing information.  <strong>[</strong>Shows the <a href="http://www.dhr.history.vt.edu/">Digital History Reader</a><strong>]</strong></p>

<p>10:58 - Students and teachers have a wealth of information at their  hands with digital history.  <strong>[</strong>Shows <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/index.html">LOC American Memory</a><strong>]</strong>.   Other web-based databases like EBSCO and JSTOR, humanitists find their  work processes simplified.  Rather than locating sources in physical  archives, the web cuts that process down to sometimes less than a minute  as search mechanisms bring data to one&#8217;s screen instantly.</p>

<p>11:00 - Digital archives and digitally based research allows  historians to develop more complex forms of presenting the past.   Immersion in the digital realm allows historians to deal effectively  with multiple voices, multiple outcomes and convey the interrelated  experiences in the past.</p>

<p>11:01 - With more sources online, researchers require sophisticated  tools to categorize historical sources.  Del.icio.us allows people to  organize bookmarks on the web, tag websites that allow one to draw  connections.  <a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> helps with the collection,  management, and citation of historical sources.  These tools allow  historians to manage data more easily.</p>

<p>11:03 - Digital historical scholarship can create new forms of  analysis that exploit the new tools offered to historians.  Rather than  just placing data online, digital historical scholarship should make  sense of the information.  Furthermore, users can inspect the sources  cited by historians, which enhances dialog between readers and  historians.</p>

<p>11:04 - Since people often turn to the web first for information and  stop there, historians need to play a role in developing scholarship.   Digital scholarship can help historians connect with the general  readership.  Yet, the profession has yet to generate peer review and  standards for digital scholarship.</p>

<p>11:05 - Historians should maintain an active role, yet the historical  profession plays little role in encouraging the development.  Quoted Ed  Ayers: Until scholarship can hold its own with the best work on paper,  tenure and promotion will remain elusive.   This is the wrong message to  send.  The presentation of history needs to transform.</p>

<p>11:07 - Digital history presents the complexity of the past <strong>[</strong>shows  the <a href="http://valley.vcdh.virginia.edu/">Valley of the Shadow</a><strong>]</strong>.   Primary sources, analysis, and interactive maps weave together.   Hypertext points users to interpretive essays, secondary sources, and  primary sources.  In no book can one make the associational links that  are possible with digital history.  Quotes Burton: History needs  something else other than the monograph, and digital scholarship is the  alternative.</p>

<p>11:08 - Careful to point out the potential problems with  digitization.  What will historians use to assess the late twentieth  century and beyond?  How to preserve items online?  Nothing tangible  exists with digital material.</p>

<p>11:10 - Personal records and government records (email, social  networking, blogs, instant messages) are increasingly electronic and,  often, lost to the &#8220;custodians of memory&#8221; (archivists, curators, museum  specialists).</p>

<p>11:12 - Even if a person saved all email to a disk, archives may not  be able to access that data.  Digital records may not be accessible as  technology changes and advances.  &#8220;A dark age for historians from 1980  onward.&#8221;  Preserving this digital information is of tantamount  importance to the historical record.  Some attempts have been made to  preserve electronic records, such as the Wayback Machine at  Archives.org.  But the <a href="http://www.archive.org/index.php">Internet Archive</a> is far  from the complete solution because it does not keep the records that  also vex the National Archives.  Additionally, quoting Rosenzweig,  saving web sites for preservation would essentially mean saving the  entire web since all sites link to one another.  Historians need to call  for preservation and access to allow historians to engage fully with  the digital tools.  With preservation uncertain, we may see a future  where we have little evidence to assess the past.</p>

<p>11:16 - Prof. Seefeldt takes the stage.  Commonalities between the  two papers.  Both discuss developing communities of scholars and modes  of communication, including evaluation and review and authenticity.   Each paper have, at their core, the distinctive and &#8220;intoxicating&#8221;  influence on their respective disciplines.</p>

<p>11:18 - Addresses Susannah&#8217;s paper.  She&#8217;s been working for 2 years  on a <a href="http://www.unl.edu/ucare/">UCARE </a>project, which will be  included in <a href="http://unlhistory.unl.edu/">Nebraska U: A Collaborative  History</a>.  The archival material she&#8217;s working with will be digitally  accessible, and will need to be preserved, as Brent addressed.</p>

<p>11:20 - Susannah suggested that research changed in the 19th century.   Instead, students collected, compiled, and studied specimens by  working in the field.  Moving away from memorization to groundbreaking  research was cutting edge for its time, much like digital scholarship  offers today.  The Botanical Seminar is an example of the transformation  at work - a significant role personalities play in building these  networks.  The students raised the bar in their academic curriculum.</p>

<p>11:23 - Professors expect students to be adventuresome, while faculty  tends to stick in the mud.  To find a space where they can safely and  fruitfully discuss new trends says a lot for the community being  developed.</p>

<p>11:27 - Addressing arguments in reverse order.  Abby Smith says that  web based content is only 10-15% of digital content right now.  There  are significant numbers of data below the sites made up of all kinds of  things.  These other objects are things we need to think about.</p>

<p>11:30 - Smith defines 1) published material (ie, Google Books); 2)  Unpublished personal, business, and government material (blogs,  del.icio.us).  3) Public to the web - electronic files placed online.   Average life of a website is 44 days.  We&#8217;ve all been to places where  sites no longer exist.  4) Deep web and databases, things that are  queryable but are not seen unless you do an executable function.  These  databases are designed to be updated, and override older information.   These are the main challenges.</p>

<p>11:32 - Guiding principles: 1) More is better than less - save as  much as we can.  2) Democracy is better than autocracy.  3) Communities  of knowledge are better and selecting and protecting information, who  determine what&#8217;s worth saving rather than policy committees.  For  instance, how is the Rawley being preserved?  Furthermore, historians  are being invited to contribute to the conversation with librarians who  are the information specialists and archivists.</p>

<p>11:34 - Storage vs. preservation ties to the idea of access.   Preserving digital material is a wide prospect.  Preserving executable  files require operating programs.  What is the value of these old files,  and what needs to be preserved?  We store information on thumb drives,  we burn CDs, we have information on floppy drives or, older yet, the wax  cylinder.  There&#8217;s a moving target - not only the content of the file,  but the hardware necessarily to access the content.  We must think about  preservation as the cost of having access.</p>

<p>11:38 - Question between digital historical scholarship and the  profession at large - the 800 pound gorilla in the room.  Leaves this  open to questions in the audience.</p>

<p>11:40 - We need to lead by example and work the digital tools into  the tradition of historical scholarship.</p>

<p>11:42 - Digital historians trying to create a community of peers who,  not only try and understand the complexities of the new field, but take  advantage of the digital tools.  UNL&#8217;s <a href="http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/">Digital History</a> site  allows for an open discussion among those interested in the digital  realm.  We&#8217;re at the beginning of this process of assessing and creating  guidelines.</p>

<p>With that, we break for lunch and the keynote speech by Professor  Emeritus Joan Jensen of New Mexico State University, who will be  discussing &#8220;Another Look At Family: Recovering Our Familial Past.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I&#8217;ve made some minor fixes to the text.</p>
