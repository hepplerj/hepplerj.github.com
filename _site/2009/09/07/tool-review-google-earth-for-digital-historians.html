<h1>Tool Review: Google Earth for Digital Historians</h1>

<p><em>[Review cross-posted at <a href="http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/t-reviews/geheppler.html">Digital History</a> and originally written in HIST 970: Digital History.]</em></p>

<p>With tools like Google Earth, historians can construct interactive  and engaging forms of history. Users can generate graphical  representations of events to visually convey events. For instance,  Google and the US Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) collaborated to  spread awareness of the genocide in Darfur [<a href="http://www.ushmm.org/maps/projects/darfur/" target="_blank">link</a>].  The overlay they generated includes descriptive HTML that presents  users with first-hand testimonies, pictures, the locations of refugee  camps, and links to video clips. The Darfur map included an overlay that  could be turned on that displayed 3D columns to visually represent the  numbers of displaced persons. Teachers may speak of 200,000 displaced  individuals, but to visually represent such numbers conveys greater  weight to a subject. The same approach could be taken with historical  events, such as using columns to display war casualties in World War II  or the location and relevant information of Nazi death camps.  Additionally, students could get an idea of how early cartographers  viewed the planet with the Dave Rumsey historical maps [<a href="http://www.davidrumsey.com/" target="_blank">link</a>] or  explore the geographic and historical data related to the 1906 San  Francisco earthquake [<a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/virtualtour/index.php" target="_blank">link</a>].</p>

<p><img title="More..." src="http://tdhxp.wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Furthermore, since Google Earth is a map in a virtual environment,  teachers can literally &#8220;fly&#8221; students through the terrain that, for  instance, Alexander the Great traveled and fought [<a href="http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showflat.php/Cat/0/Number/126402/an/0/page/1#126402" target="_blank">link</a>]. The ability to see the geography raises new  questions and can give students a real sense of what actors in the past  dealt with. Taking the students down to the hilly coastal terrain that  Alexander and his troops confronted in the Siege of Halicarnassus gives  them a clear idea of what they dealt with. The included image overlay  conveys not just the geography, but the historical layout of  Halicarnassus as it looked in 334 BCE. Pathways can be applied to the  terrain to visualize the route armies took over the land. Students could  likewise examine the terrain and see battle maps of Alexander&#8217;s fight  against Darius III in the Battle of Issus.</p>

<p>What ties all of these ideas together is not just the ability to show  students something new and exciting, but for them to interact with the  tools. Students are free to explore spatial information in constructing  historical arguments rather than just present information through  lectures and texts. Google Earth also presents the opportunity to  increase the exposure to primary sources, including maps, documents at  the Library of Congress, or films deposited at the Internet Archive.  In Marie-Laure Ryan&#8217;s piece, &#8220;Will New Media Produce New  Narratives?&#8221;, engaging users with interactive  material (in Ryan&#8217;s case, hypertext) allows them to draw connections on  their own and explore the past through a variety of mediums.</p>

<p>Google Earth presents many &#8220;wow&#8221; moments as well. The Lewis and Clark  map overlay provided by Rumsey was one of those moments. A flat map on a  table or in a book might give an idea of what they experienced, but to  see the map and discover the breadth of the area they traveled. The  archival record is given context not to who or when, but to the terrain  and a global picture. An overlay of 1853 San Francisco does not stand  alone, but connects itself to the surrounding region and gives users a  greater sense of the geography and historical changes that occurred over  time.</p>

<p>While we cannot embed Google Earth into our digital scholarship, we  can certainly offer the files to readers for them to download and  interact with our work. The descriptive HTML can explain key spatial  points to our scholarship and include hyperlinks to categories like  interpretive essays, secondary literature, and primary sources.  Hyperlinking to our online scholarship keeps the project self-contained  and thus contributes to project sustainability. Additionally, the  XML-based KML encoding ensures a sustainable digitized collection. The  interactive possibilities with Google Earth serve historians, students,  and general readers in exploring spatial relationships in history.</p>
