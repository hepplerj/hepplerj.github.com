<h1>On Podcasts</h1>

<p><em>[This post originally appeared at <a href="http://www.gradhacker.org/2012/09/02/digital-distractions-podcasts/">Gradhacker</a> on 2012-09-03]</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;m stealing a page from Profhacker and talking about <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/tag/digital-distractions">digital distractions</a>. One of my favorite distractions is podcasts. I love them. They&#8217;re part of my commute, they&#8217;re part of my leisure time, and they&#8217;re part of my work time. It&#8217;s rare to see me without headphones, catching up on my favorite shows. Using <a href="http://www.downcastapp.com">Downcast for iPhone</a> has made it even easier for me to download the latest episodes of the podcasts I love.</p>

<p>Here are a few of my favorites:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Back to Work</a>, 5by5<br />
Hosted by Dan Benjamin and Merlin Mann on the 5by5 network, the topic is generally about getting your work done, removing barriers, and Mann is a genuinely entertaining individual, so the show contains plenty of comedy bits in addition to being super helpful about thinking about your work.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/">Roderick on the Line</a><br />
Hosted by John Roderick (of <a href="http://www.thelongwinters.com/">The Long Winters</a>) and Merlin Mann, ROTL took me a while to get in to, in part because it can be inscrutable, but it&#8217;s now it&#8217;s a can&#8217;t-miss show. It&#8217;s definitely NSFW and can be offensive, but it&#8217;s often quite funny. Think of it as though you&#8217;re listening in on a phone call between Mann and Roderick (which is, essentially, what the show does). A few of my favorite episodes are <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-42-your-hands-would-be-your-passport.html">Your Hands Would Be Your Passport</a> and <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-20-we-can-all-agree-on-cheese.html">We Can All Agree On Cheese</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://youlooknicetoday.com">You Look Nice Today</a><br />
Hosted by Scott Simpson, Adam Lisagor, and Merlin Mann (if you haven&#8217;t noticed, I&#8217;m a big Merlin Mann fan), YLNT is a comedy troupe that&#8217;s been on and off for the last few years. YLNT comes out every month and is fairly short, usually between 30 and 45 minutes. It&#8217;s an incredibly entertaining and well-produced show. Check out the <a href="http://youlooknicetoday.tumblr.com/post/20183855956/the-you-look-nice-today-starter-pack">YLNT starter pack</a> if you want to know where to dive in.</li>
  <li><a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze">Build and Analyze</a>, 5by5<br />
Hosted by Dan Benjamin and Marco Arment, the founder of Instapaper, B&amp;A discusses the world of Apple programming, and development. I find the discussions between Benjamin and Arment about current technology to be quite insightful and entertaining.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.70decibels.com/enough/">Enough</a>, 70Decibels<br />
Hosted by Patrick Rhone and Myke Hurley, Enough seeks to find where technology becomes enough to get your work done. I&#8217;m a big fan of Rhone and his work, and find his ideas and discussion on Enough a good way to think about the role of technology in my life.&lt;/li&gt;</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.70decibels.com/cmdspace/">CMD+SPACE</a>, 70Decibels<br />
Hosted by Myke Hurley, CMD+SPACE has quickly become one of my favorite interview podcasts. Hurley recently launched the show in the last month and has interviewed some people I greatly admire, including <a href="http://www.70decibels.com/cmdspace/2012/8/1/001-im-yelling-at-me-with-merlin-mann.html">Merlin Mann</a>, <a href="http://www.70decibels.com/cmdspace/2012/8/8/002-light-pink-looks-likes-gray-to-me-with-jason-snell.html">Jason Snell</a>, <a href="http://www.70decibels.com/cmdspace/2012/8/15/003-memberships-and-being-classy-with-shawn-blanc.html">Shawn Blanc</a>, and <a href="http://www.70decibels.com/cmdspace/2012/8/28/005-being-a-harsh-self-critic-with-marco-arment.html">Marco Arment</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical">Hypercritical</a>, 5by5<br />
Hosted by Dan Benjamin and John Siracusa, this show fulfills all of my hyper-geekiness: video games, Apple, technology, filesystems. Siracusa has a reputation as being a fierce tech critic (hence the show&#8217;s name) while being entertaining in his delivery. He is perhaps most famous for his impressive and thorough <a href="charlesorourke.com/articles/siracusa-macosx-reviews">Mac OS X reviews</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(It should be pretty clear by now that I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="http://5by5.tv">5by5</a> and the work Dan Benjamin is doing with it. 5by5 has, I believe, rightfully been called the &#8220;NPR for Geeks.&#8221;)</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.radiolab.org/">Radiolab</a>, NPR<br />
Not all of my podcasts are strictly technology related. Radiolab covers ideas, technology, science, and philosophy and its intersections with the human experience. I love and am endlessly fascinated by science, and Radiolab lets me geek out about science and the modern world.</li>
  <li><a href="http://digitalcampus.tv">Digital Campus</a><br />
Hosted by Dan Cohen, Tom Scheinfeldt, Amanda French, and Mills Kelly, Digital Campus is an additional way I keep up with how technology intersects with teaching, learning, and scholarship in higher education. Graduate students, faculty, administration, and staff in higher education should be listening to this podcast.</li>
  <li><a href="http://podcast.gradhacker.org/">The Gradhacker Podcast</a><br />
The newly launched Gradhacker Podcast hosted by Alex Galarza and Andrea Zellner nicely parallels Digital Campus but approaches education, productivity, teaching, and learning from the perspective of graduate students.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/">On the Media</a>, NPR<br />
Hosted by Bob Garfield and Brooke Gladstone, On the Media covers journalism and the changing nature of the media. The show is a great look at the previous week&#8217;s big news items, examines freedom of information and expression, and analyzes the way media, especially news media, is made.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a variety of other podcasts that I more selectively catch: <a href="http://5by5.tv/amplified">Amplified</a>, <a href="http://www.70decibels.com/homework/">Home Work</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/ia">The Ihnatko Almanac</a>, <a href="http://twit.tv/show/the-tech-guy">The Tech Guy</a>, <a href="http://twit.tv/twig">This Week in Google</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/inbeta">In Beta</a>, <a href="http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/">Buddhist Geeks</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/nickel/">The Nickel</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/incomparable">The Incomparable</a>,Â <a href="http://5by5.tv/paleo">Latest in Paleo</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic">Systematic</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/incomparable">The Incomparable</a>.</p>
