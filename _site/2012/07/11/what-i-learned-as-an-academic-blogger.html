<h1>What I've Learned as an Academic Blogger</h1>

<p>In 2008, a year after I graduated college and a year into my Masters program, I started JasonHeppler.org.<sup id="fnref:fn-precise"><a href="#fn:fn-precise" class="footnote">1</a></sup> My writing here started out slowly, as a visit to the <a href="http://jasonheppler.org/archives.html">archives</a> can attest. Even so, I never wanted the site to become overwhelming either for myself to maintain or readers that find enjoyment in the things I write about or link to. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been reflecting on the things I&#8217;ve learned as an academic blogger, and <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2012/07/50-things/">Shawn Blanc&#8217;s recent post</a> prompted me to write up a few things I&#8217;ve learned over the last four years of writing here.<sup id="fnref:fn1-blogging"><a href="#fn:fn1-blogging" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Here&#8217;s an unordered list of thirty things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Give yourself permission to write poorly.</li>
  <li>Don&#8217;t write what you don&#8217;t want the world to see. Things around here are permanent. (Same is true with Twitter, Facebook, and elsewhere).</li>
  <li>Twitter and blogs are as valuable as conferences.</li>
  <li>Lots of people share your interests. Sharing your opinions and ideas helps you stand out.</li>
  <li>Don&#8217;t be rude.</li>
  <li>Own your own domain. Don&#8217;t rely on Twitter, Facebook, Google, or department web pages for your online presence.</li>
  <li>Seriously, <a href="https://www.hover.com/">go buy a domain</a> if you don&#8217;t own one yet. Grab your name if you can. Get on Twitter while you&#8217;re at it.</li>
  <li>Content is more important than pageviews.</li>
  <li>Content is more important than form.</li>
  <li>Take this work seriously.</li>
  <li>Don&#8217;t take yourself too seriously.</li>
  <li>Go outside.</li>
  <li>Tweaking your design, blogging system, taxonomy, and so on is procrastination.</li>
  <li>Do your research.</li>
  <li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to offend someone. As an undergraduate professor use to tell me all the time about my writing: <strong>be bold</strong>.</li>
  <li>Admit when you&#8217;re wrong.</li>
  <li>Be humble.</li>
  <li>You don&#8217;t have to publish the moment you&#8217;ve written the last paragraph.</li>
  <li>You&#8217;re a writer, not a blogger.</li>
  <li>Thinking and reading about writing is not the same as writing.</li>
  <li>Learn something new every day.</li>
  <li>Your digital presence generates real relationships. </li>
  <li>A digital presence leads to friendships and opportunities.</li>
  <li>Sometimes web comments are great. Most of the time <a href="http://www.jasonheppler.org/2011/03/01/why-i-dont-use-a-commenting-system.html">they&#8217;re not</a>. </li>
  <li>Meaningful discussions happen on blogs and Twitter.</li>
  <li>Write every day.</li>
  <li>Read every day.</li>
  <li>Take publicness seriously. Writing for your own site is a big leap into being a publically-oriented scholar rather than insular and ivory-towered. </li>
  <li>Don&#8217;t think you have to write about Only One Thing. You have various interests inside and outside the academy, your writing can reflect that.</li>
  <li>Work hard. Doing work is hard work.</li>
</ul>

<p>The overall theme here is to be online. I cannot overstate how important it is to be engaged digitally, ideally on both blogs and Twitter where the humanities community is quite active. I credit my online presence with opening up some professional opportunities that have come my way recently (which I&#8217;m not going to reveal right now) as well as introducing me to a lot of people who I admire. The act of writing consistently helps you as a writer, but doing so publically adds to your online reputation as well. You are doing yourself a favor, in a job market that&#8217;s already extremely competitive, by writing for the web.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:fn-precise">
      <p>To be more precise, I actually started writing for a WordPress blog I called Digital Clio, a collaborative blog I started with Brent Rogers. We both fell out of regular writing mainly due to busy schedules, but I moved my posts from DC over to here.<a href="#fnref:fn-precise" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:fn1-blogging">
      <p>This list could also have been titled &#8220;What I&#8217;ve Learned as an Academic Tweeter.&#8221; Twitter has also proven an important medium for myself both personally and professionally. I joined Twitter roughly around the same time I started blogging.<a href="#fnref:fn1-blogging" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
