<p>I&#8217;ve moved on to the free tier of Newsblur for syncing items between devices (and the free tier offers one more advantage: keeping my RSS reading limit very small since it only allows up to 64 sites) and ReadKit for my MacBook (I use Newsblur&#8217;s iOS app on the mobile devices). I could probably give up syncing since the majority of my time is spent in front of my MacBook on a Wi-Fi connection. But in the case where I&#8217;d like access to my items, like riding Caltrain, I can access them on my phone. </p>

<p>The end of Google Reader is probably going to be a good thing. An area of technology that had gone a bit stale may be invigorated by people looking for new solutions. </p>

        <div class="hero" style="background-image: url(/images/spencer.jpg);"></div>

<p>On the evening of May 30, 1998, I was laying in bed listening to the local radio. About an hour and a half or so before, I was driving with my dad on South Dakota Highway 37 north towards Huron, South Dakota. We were heading for the dirt track races, but turned around after the races were canceled due to severe weather in the area. That night, the news on the radio was terrifying: the small town of Spencer, South Dakota, which lay just twenty miles from my hometown, had been destroyed by a tornado. The storm was among the most destructive in South Dakota&#8217;s history. For the next few weeks I collected every front page story my hometown paper ran about the tornado; I still have those newspapers stored away in a box.</p>

<p>The United States faces more tornadoes than any other country in the world, averaging around 810 every year. The Spencer tornado occurred during one of the worst tornado years on record, which saw 124 recorded tornados.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Moore, Oklahoma, lies within the heaviest tornado activity in the United States, an area known as Tornado Alley that stretches across the Great Plains. The phrase comes from Air Force meteorologists Major Ernest Fawbush and Captain Robert Miller, who coined the phrase &#8220;tornado alley&#8221; in 1953 during their research studying severe weather in the central plains.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Although every state has the potential to experience a tornado, the storms are heaviest in the land between Texas and South Dakota between the Rocky Mountains to the west and the Missouri River to the east.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tornadoes.jpg" alt="Historical paths of tornadoes" /></p>

<p>Growing up on the Plains, severe weather was a common occurrence between the months of May and September. Warm coastal airs blow up from the Gulf of Mexico northward and collide with dry, colder continental air coming from the Rocky Mountains, creating a volatile climate that is the seedbed for supercell thunderstorms. Today&#8217;s tornado that hit Moore, Oklahoma, and the haunting stories and images emerging from reports reminded me of the destructive force of the Spencer tornado. The Spencer tornado clocked wind speeds upwards of 246 miles per hour. Preliminary measurements of the Moore storm <a href="http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/smartnews/2013/05/how-to-understand-the-scale-of-todays-oklahoma-tornado/">measured wind speeds at 199 miles per hour</a>. </p>

<p>Today&#8217;s storm was not Moore&#8217;s first encounter with strong tornadoes. Thirteen years ago, another intense tornado swept by Moore, with wind speeds <a href="http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/smartnews/2013/05/how-to-understand-the-scale-of-todays-oklahoma-tornado/">peaking at 302 miles per hour</a>. Although wind speeds were lower in today&#8217;s storm, the storm&#8217;s destructive potential was amplified by its <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSNorman/status/336590735832928256">40-minute presence on the ground</a>; tornadoes are often on the ground only for moments, but today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/us/tornado-oklahoma.html?_r=1&amp;">mile-wide and long-duration</a> storm tore a deadly path of destruction across Oklahoma. The American West often sees extremes in weather and climate, sometimes with deadly consequences.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ok_path.png" alt="Moore, Oklahoma tornado path" /></p>

<p>My best wishes for safety and recovery go to the city of Moore and the state of Oklahoma. To those injured, I wish speedy recovery; to those lost, my heartfelt condolences.</p>

        <p><em>[This post originally appeared at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/group/ats/cgi-bin/hivetalkin/?p=3331">Hive Talkin&#8217;</a> on 2013-04-18.]</em></p>

<p>In 1814, Thomas Jefferson offered his personal library &#8211; some fifty years in the making &#8211; to the newly established Library of Congress. His library of works on philosophy, history, science, and literature were meant for &#8220;everything which related to America, and indeed whatever was rare and valuable in every science.&#8221; Jefferson loved knowledge, and the donation of his private library to the Library of Congress <a href="http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/images/vc221.jpg">allowed the new library</a> to &#8220;become the depository of unquestionably the choicest collection of books in the US, and I hope it will not be without some general effect on the literature of our country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Today marks the beginning of a new effort at &#8220;the choicest collection&#8221; of material in the form of the Digital Public Library of America. The conversation began <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/07/inside-the-quest-to-put-the-worlds-libraries-online/259967/">two and a half years ago</a>, when forty-two American libraries discussed where their future lay in the digital world. The answer to their question: a digital public library, national in scope and delivering open content. DPLA solves an issue with digital archives, libraries, and museums by bringing them all together and facilitating the discovery of images, photographs, artwork, and published and unpublished material. The mission, as <a href="http://dp.la/info/">described</a> by DPLA, is to bring together &#8220;the riches of America&#8217;s libraries, archives, and museums, and makes them freely available to the world&#8221; and &#8220;expand this crucial realm of openly available materials, and make those riches more easily discovered and more widely usable and used.&#8221;</p>

<p>DPLA not only makes available the material, but becomes an advocate for the open access of material. DPLA contains around 2 million documents so far from collections at the Smithsonian, the National Archives, the New York Public Library, Harvard, and the University of Virginia, as well as regional libraries like the Mountain West Digital Library and the Minnesota Digital Library. DPLA brings this material together in an interface that makes discovery easy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with DPLA all morning, and there are three areas of DPLA I&#8217;m thinking about today:</p>

<h2 id="teaching">Teaching</h2>

<p>Without a doubt, access to material in DPLA presents a wonderful pedagogical opportunity. Material that could have been difficult to access or unknown to students now has the ability to be discovered. Research projects that require working with primary sources now have another starting point for research, in addition to the tools we already use in our work. A research project on American civil rights movements might start with a keyword search on Malcolm X, which pulls in sources and metadata from collections at Yale, Utah State Historical Society, the University of Illinois-Urbana, and elsewhere.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stanford.edu/group/ats/cgi-bin/hivetalkin/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/malcolmx.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3333" src="https://www.stanford.edu/group/ats/cgi-bin/hivetalkin/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/malcolmx-300x237.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="237" /></a></p>

<p>Search terms can also be explored spatially by narrowing on the location or viewed on a timeline for chronological exploration.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stanford.edu/group/ats/cgi-bin/hivetalkin/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sideby.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3335" src="https://www.stanford.edu/group/ats/cgi-bin/hivetalkin/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sideby-300x113.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="113" /></a></p>

<p>Discovery doesn&#8217;t have to be serendipitous either. Courses on the history of civil rights, women, and Native America, for example, can consult exhibits already built within DPLA. Exhibits contain narratives about thematic historical moments and pull in primary source material related to the themes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stanford.edu/group/ats/cgi-bin/hivetalkin/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/mkl_speech.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3337" src="https://www.stanford.edu/group/ats/cgi-bin/hivetalkin/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/mkl_speech-300x236.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="236" /></a></p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p>DPLA has already been giving a place in my bookmark folder that contains my go-to places for research, alongside ProQuest, Google, and JSTOR. DPLA serves a similar purpose as research databases by aggregating diverse collections together under a single interface. Scholars and students alike have a variety of methods for drilling down into the material by narrowing on categories like location, date, and repositories. Subject tags also allow me to explore other avenues and similarly-categorized material.</p>

<p>Already, in the short amount of time I&#8217;ve spent with the DPLA, I&#8217;ve explored some of my dissertation research into the urban history of the Santa Clara Valley and uncovered period-specific maps that I&#8217;ll find useful in understanding how urban space grew and developed over time. I look forward to spending more time with DPLA as a research tool, trying out different queries and following subject tags to see what I uncover.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stanford.edu/group/ats/cgi-bin/hivetalkin/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bracero_research.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3339" src="https://www.stanford.edu/group/ats/cgi-bin/hivetalkin/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bracero_research-300x236.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="236" /></a></p>

<h2 id="building">Building</h2>

<p>I haven&#8217;t dug deeply into this yet, but DPLA <a href="http://dp.la/info/developers/">provides an API</a> for those who want to build platforms to take advantage of the DPLA&#8217;s collections. <a href="http://dp.la/apps/1">Harvard</a> and <a href="http://dp.la/apps/2">Europeana</a> have already built impressive apps using the API. DPLA sees itself as a platform, and developers have an opportunity to make use of the available data and explore cultural heritage collections. DPLA itself is open source, and has placed <a href="https://github.com/dpla">all of its code on Github</a> already.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stanford.edu/group/ats/cgi-bin/hivetalkin/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/apps.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3341" src="https://www.stanford.edu/group/ats/cgi-bin/hivetalkin/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/apps-300x237.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="237" /></a></p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of promise behind DPLA already in the early stages of aggregating our digitized cultural heritage collections, promoting public engagement, pooling metadata, and supporting methods for accessing the material. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing more and more collections brought into the fold and broadening our ability browse, read, and create.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Elsevier’s practices make me deeply deeply angry. While academic publishing as a whole is pretty flawed, Elsevier takes the most insidious practices further at each and every turn, always at the expense of those of us who are trying to produce, publish, and distribute research. Their prices are astronomical, bankrupting libraries and siloing knowledge for private profit off of free labor. As a result, many mathematicians and other scientists have begun stepping off of their editorial boards in protest. Along with over 13,000 other scholars, I too signed the Cost of Knowledge boycott.</p>

  <p>I see no indication of a reformed Elsevier, no indication of a path forward that is actually respectful of scholars, scholarship, librarians, or universities. All I see is a company looking to make a profit in an unethical manner and trying to assuage angry customers and laborers with small tokens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot to agree with in danah&#8217;s post. I tried out Mendeley some
time ago but never got on the platform, instead preferring Zotero (which
		I&#8217;ve been using for almost 5 years now). But more importantly,
	 for me, isn&#8217;t what happened to Mendeley. I was never a user of the
	 service so their purchase doesn&#8217;t affect me in any tangible way.
	 But danah&#8217;s larger point about open access and the labor of
	 scholars is key. The knowledge and information we create as
	 scholars shouldn&#8217;t be locked behind expensive silos or straining
	 library budgets with exorbitant subscriptions. We have an
	 <a href="http://jasonheppler.org/2011/10/25/the-obligation-of-open-access.html">obligation</a>
	 to make our work available to anyone who might be interested in
	 accessing it.</p>

        <p>Next week, April 8th-12th, William G. Thomas and Patrick Jones will be hosting virtual sessions on <a href="http://historyharvest.unl.edu">History Harvest</a> for anyone interested in learning more. I had the good fortune of participating in the first History Harvest in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 2010, and have watched the program grow over the last couple of years. And for all of the talk surrounding MOOCs, it&#8217;s refreshing to see alternative approaches to utilizing technology that better serves students (indeed, the <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/history-harvest-project-may-spawn-a-new-kind-of-mooc/41329">Chronicle has called this</a> a &#8220;new kind of MOOC&#8221;).</p>

<p>The plan for next week&#8217;s <a href="http://railroads.unl.edu/blog/?p=1009">Blitz Week</a> is to open participation into the strategic planning of History Harvest and offering an overview of the project generally. If you&#8217;re looking to learn more about History Harvest generally, I&#8217;d check out the <a href="http://historyharvest.unl.edu">official site</a> or <a href="http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/2013/1301/History-Harvests_Students-Digitize-Peoples-History.cfm">this piece in Perspectives</a>. Professor Thomas details the plans behind Blitz Week <a href="http://railroads.unl.edu/blog/?p=1009">here</a> and <a href="http://railroads.unl.edu/blog/?p=1023">here</a>.</p>

<p>I love the idea behind History Harvest and the accompanying research, pedagogical, and public history aspects embedded in the program. The community-driven aspect really resonates with me, and the technology available to us &#8211; digital cameras, audio recorders, digital archival platforms like Omeka &#8211; means we have tools available to conduct and deploy such projects. Pedagogically, History Harvest provides an opportunity to have undergraduates and graduate students involved in every aspect of the project. The work happens outside the classroom and gets students and the community working hands-on with the collection, preservation, and interpretation of history &#8211; plus, there&#8217;s an added advantage of equipping students with digital skills. I really enjoyed my experience with the project, and would readily welcome an opportunity to participate in future History Harvests.</p>

<p>I would highly encourage you to contact <a href="http://history.unl.edu/facultystaff/profile.asp?ID=34">Professor Thomas</a> or <a href="http://history.unl.edu/facultystaff/profile.asp?ID=134">Professor Jones</a> if you&#8217;re interested in learning more and get involved next week!</p>
