<h1>Using Notational Velocity</h1>

<p>One of my favorite Mac programs is <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a>. I do a lot of writing with it &#8211; everything from meeting notes, to jotting down ideas, to creating reference files and running lists, even occasionally to write up longer-form content like blog posts or research (though I tend to use TextMate for most long-form writing). </p>

<p>Notational Velocity (or the fork I use, <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/">nvALT</a>) follows the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">One Thing Well</a> philosophy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It&#8217;s lightweight.</li>
  <li>It allows you to just write no frills text.</li>
  <li>Text is saved automatically.</li>
  <li>Text can be found very simply through the built-in progressive search.</li>
</ul>

<p>The entire system makes it very easy to focus on writing. You don&#8217;t need to click &#8220;New File&#8221; or anything else &#8211; simply type in the new file you&#8217;d like to create and hit Return and you&#8217;re ready to go. You never have to use the mouse, even; just hit Cmd-L and your cursor is placed in the location bar. Type in your file, press Return, and start writing.</p>

<h3 id="my-setup">My Setup</h3>

<p>My setup is pretty simple. Here a few things I&#8217;ve done with my setup:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Under Preferences, I&#8217;ve set up Notational Velocity to store everything as plain text files. Plain text, after all, is <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/07/21/word-internet/">the most portable, the most searchable, the most light weight medium for your writing</a>. I can work on my writing on my laptop, or access the files on my phone if I need to.</li>
  <li>I use to have the system synchronize with Simplenote, but I&#8217;ve turned this feature off recently. Instead, I have all of my notes synchronized to Dropbox. Everything is backed up and with me where ever I have an internet connection.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>

<p>Now here comes the geeky side of things. My system is very similar to the <a href="http://macpowerusers.com/2011/03/mpu-046-workflows-with-merlin-mann-ii/">system used by Merlin Mann</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>All of my notes are appended with, for lack of a better word, &#8220;tags&#8221; that I use to group items together and reference things quickly. For example, my blog post brainstorms or drafts are prefixed with &#8220;blogx&#8221; followed by a potential post title and finally I use a TextExpander snippet to insert the full date and time (for example, a Notational line for this post might look like &#8220;blogx jahx Using Notational Velocity 2011-07-22_23-05-06&#8221;). Like Merlin, I use the &#8220;x&#8221; at the end of my prefixes to quickly find things. I want to see all my blog material? I type &#8220;blogx&#8221;. I want a list of my running lists? I search for &#8220;runx&#8221;. Some of these are narrowed down: blogx is usually followed by &#8220;jahx&#8221; (my initials, a post meant for this site) or &#8220;tcx&#8221; (a blog post for Tumblr). </li>
  <li>For frequently used items I use <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/453204090/q-trick">Merlin Mann&#8217;s &#8220;q trick&#8221;</a>. If I have a file I reference frequently or want to locate quickly, I follow it with a number of q&#8217;s, starting with at least two and usually going up to five. For example, I have a file called &#8220;TODAY agenda [qqqqq]&#8221; that I store my &#8220;most important things&#8221; to-do list in of things I want to accomplish that day. It&#8217;s faster to type multiple q&#8217;s rather than start searching for the individual file. </li>
  <li>I may draft up ideas for blog posts or research projects in Notational Velocity, but I normally do most of my writing in TextMate. I like the feel of TextMate, and it also just does One Thing Well.</li>
  <li>There&#8217;s nothing that <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> go into Notational Velocity. I currently have around 270 text files in Notational Velocity, sometimes nothing more than a single line of text. I frequently dump often-used snippets into Notational and are titled with a &#8220;refx&#8221; prefix (like an HTML snippet or command line function like the one I use to convert markdown to PDF; if used often enough these become snippets in TextExpander).</li>
</ol>

<p>The point of all this crazy taxonomy is to allow me to <em>not have to think very hard about what I&#8217;m after</em>. I want to find what I&#8217;m looking for immediately, without having to waste a lot of time searching the back of my brain with the half-remembered thought. Nor do I want to always fire up a browser and search for what I&#8217;m looking for. If I&#8217;ve found a method that works and that requires a reference or running list or whatever, it goes into Notational for future reference.</p>

<p>The additional advantage to this system is it isn&#8217;t tied to a specific computer platform. If I left the Mac operating system for Linux, for example, I still have all of my plaintext files that I can easily still write in or search through the command line or an equivalent program in Linux. I also like having everything with me in Dropbox where ever I&#8217;m at. If I&#8217;m waiting at a doctor&#8217;s appointment, standing in line at the store, or just killing some time, I can pull up my files and find something to work on or scratch out an idea.</p>

<p>Finally, everything is written in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. Whether I&#8217;m working in Notational Velocity, <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.kooklab.epistle">Epistle</a>, TextMate, or Scrivener, Markdown is my preferred plain text writing syntax. </p>
