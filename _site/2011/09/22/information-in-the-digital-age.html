<h1>Information and Data in the Digital Age</h1>

<p><em>[This is a reading reflection written for HIST946: Digital Humanities with Professor William Thomas during the Fall 2011 semester. This week&#8217;s readings were John Brown and Paul Duguid, *<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Social-Life-Information-Seely-Brown/dp/0875847625">The Social Life of Information</a></em>, Michel et al., &#8220;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6014/176">Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books</a>,&#8221; and Roy Rosenzweig, &#8220;<a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/essays-on-history-new-media/essays/?essayid=6">Scarcity or Abudance? Preserving the Past in a Digital Era</a>&#8221;. You can find related posts <a href="http://jasonheppler.org/the-digital-humanities-seminar.html">here</a>.]*</p>

<p>We are experiencing an age of unprecedented access to information. The vast
amount of material scanned and hosted by institutional respositories like JSTOR,
ProQuest, and Google offer researchers a wide array of sources for their tasks.
Yet this abundance of information perhaps leads to scarcity elsewhere — namely,
the methods and tools we have available to us to shed light on the information.
As John Brown and Paul Duguid note, however, information necessitates
interaction with people. &#8220;For all of information&#8217;s independence and extent,&#8221; they write,
&#8220;it is people, in their communities, organizations, and institutions, who
ultimately decide what it all means and why it matters&#8221; (Brown and Duguid, 18).
Information means little without context or interpretation, or rather
information serves purposes beyond just existing. Infoenthusiasts point to
a supremacy in technology to tell humans what the information means. There is no
need to visit dusty archives or secure travel funding. Let the keyboard be your
finding aid.</p>

<p>To an extent, there is truth to this. As my position as project manager on the
William F. Cody Digital Archive, one of our explicit goals is to provide digital
sources for researchers. It is not an easy task to get to the archives in Cody,
WY, but by putting these sources online and verifying the authenticity of the
material we are signaling to Cody researchers that they can place their trust in
the digital reproductions and, if necessary, can easily track down the physical
copy of an artifact. This is the sort of democratization that Roy Rosenzweig
spoke of, noting that &#8220;once [digitization] is accomplished, [sources] can be
made accessible to vastly greater numbers of people. To open up the archives and
libraries in this way democratizes historical work&#8221; (Rosenzweig, 756). Users
have direct access to cultural records made freely available to anyone with
a connection to the Internet.</p>

<p>This is all highly desirable: in my case, we want Cody Studies to flourish, and the building
of the Cody Archive is a step in that direction, though it is not without its
own digital challenges. Preservation is an especially important consideration.
Having the Archive backed by a digital center inside the library perhaps means
there is a good chance that the material in the archive can be preserved
digitally. Aiding in that task is the adherence to encoding and documentary
editing standards. I can say the same for my own smaller scale digital projects,
both of which were built using standards and methods designed for longevity.
However, a great deal of anxiety still exists surrounding digital artifacts.
Historically, born-digital objects have been notoriously fragile, whether that
is a magnetic tape, a compact disc, or a 3.5&#8221; floppy (Apple&#8217;s new Macbook Air
and before those the netbooks did not contain a CD-ROM drive, perhaps signaling
that the compact disc may not have much of a future left either). Digital media
undergoes such rapid transformations and innovations that preservation,
sustainability, compatibility, portability, scalability, and flexibility can become elusive
quickly (indeed, the only digital format humans have devised that manages to
maintain these categories over time is plain text).</p>

<p>More broadly, however, is the nature of information and knowledge in the
digital. As Brown and Duguid point out, information only gains value through
social use. The nature of knowledge and learning is necessarily collaborative
and communication is essential for knowledge production. Knowledge is not gained
by isolating oneself in front of a keyboard, but rather learning is a social
process where knowledge and information are transmitted not only through
physical objects (books, computers) but also by the incidental learning that
occurs through observing or speaking to colleagues. There are limitations, in
other words, on the information that we obtain. Technology shapes,
constrains, and influences the information and knowledge we gather.</p>

<p>The abudance of information coupled with the power of computation means that
humanistic inquiry into materials can be astounding. The coining of the &#8220;new&#8221;
field of culturomics in the <em>Science</em> paper by Michel et al., point to the sort
of usability scholars can achieve with digital data through their statistical
analysis of five million books digitized by Google. Although their assertion
that they are breaking new ground is annoying (since it ignores
<a href="http://www.dancohen.org/2010/12/19/initial-thoughts-on-the-google-books-ngram-viewer-and-datasets/">previous work</a>), their approach to things like the
appearance and disappearance of fame is interesting and raises the sort of
issues humanists like to discuss.</p>

<p>However, the problem with Michel et al. is the problem of abudant information.
They are the infoenthusiasts spoken of by Brown and Duguid. Too much faith is
placed in the data and results themselves. Historical trends are not simply ebbs
and flows on a graph; there is no close reading about historical events,
something
that is required when getting down to the granular elements of history. On the
technical side, the analysis depends on the accuracy of
Google&#8217;s OCR software (spend a few minutes looking at any book out of copyright
in Google Books and download the plain text of the scan and you will learn
quickly that OCR is not known for its accuracy). Related to this is the simple
fact that computers cannot read. The &#8220;dumb book&#8221; OCRed by Google has no embedded
information and cannot tell the different definitions of something like
&#8220;spring&#8221;, which may speak of the season or the activity of jumping.
There is also a question of how
accurately Google recorded metadata on the books in its corpus, not only items
like authors and titles, but dates, the publisher, the book&#8217;s format, and any
other number of attributes important to historians, literary scholars, and
linguists. More importantly, the data in Google Books is broad, not
deep. It is obvious that &#8220;slavery&#8221; would be a common term during the Civil War,
perhaps less so during Civil Rights one hundred years later. The ngrams built by
Google would be more useful and interesting if it dug into more than just
a small number of books — there is no searching in pamphlets, newspapers,
magazines, or any other number of ways people communicated through documents. In
short, Michel et al. place too much faith in information and the technology, and
do not fully consider the more granular ways that information can be used and
interpreted for knowledge.</p>

<p>We should be careful not to quantify humanistic inquiry too much. Our goal as
digital humanists is not to replicate the social science, not to become the
&#8220;science of the humanities&#8221;, nor to hinge our work on quantitative, data-rich
sources alone. Certainly computation has a role in assisting humanistic inquiry
— we cannot possibly approach the massive amounts of data or keep up with the
copious studies without the aid of computers. Interpreting culture, however,
will require not the number crunching of the machine but instead the human mind
engaged in scholarly interpretation.</p>
