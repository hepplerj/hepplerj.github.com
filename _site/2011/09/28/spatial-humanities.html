<h1>Spatial Humanities and Visual Narratives</h1>

<p><em>[This is a reading reflection written for HIST946: Digital Humanities with
Professor William Thomas during the Fall 2011 semester. This week&#8217;s readings
were Richard White, &#8220;<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=29">What is Spatial History?</a>,&#8221; Philip Ethington, &#8220;<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/history/historylab/LAPUHK/">Los Angeles
and the Problem of Urban Historical Knowledge</a>,&#8221; and David Staley, &#8220;<a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jahc/3310410.0003.304?rgn=main;view=fulltext">Historical
Visualizations</a>&#8221;. You can find related posts <a href="http://jasonheppler.org/the-digital-humanities-seminar.html">here</a>.]</em></p>

<p>Computer visualizations offer new ways for humanist scholars to reconfigure the notion of
narrative As David Staley notes, visualizations have the ability to depict
complex information into spatial form. Historical visualizations, then,
represent historical information in a visual or spatial manner rather than
verbal or linear. These methods begin to give form to new styles of narrative,
or perhaps answer <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/essays-on-history-new-media/essays/?essayid=30">Orville Vernon Burton&#8217;s call</a> for models of scholarship beyond
the written monograph.</p>

<p>Burton writes that &#8220;history, similar to all disciplines, is badly in need of
models beyond the monograph for the demonstration of excellence, and where the
scholarship itself is in need of new genres and new strategies for reaching new
audiences.&#8221; The visualization of humanistic information and data may represent one
new method for scholars to communicate their findings and research their topics
with the aid of computers.</p>

<p>New ideas about the intersections between geography, history, and theory along
with technological methods and techniques points towards methods humanist scholars
can utilize in studying the intersections between space and place. Humanists now
conceive of space more acutely, fully aware of how politics and society can
influence both physical and imaginative space. As Richard White notes, space is
not simply natural geography or a container to be filled with history. Instead
of an empty vessel awaiting historical action, space is a historical actor where
stories occur over geography and history (space and time). Space, then, is
a site of continual conflict shaped by struggles over power and definition.</p>

<p>What this all means for the humanities is a reconsideration of how technologies
like Geographic Information Systems can be applied to humanistic data. There are
various ways of doing so. For example, scholars can apply GIS to spatial
infrastructure, what Henri Lefebvre called &#8220;spatial practice,&#8221; by mapping
physical spaces from county boundaries to transnational railroad lines. The
greater challenge is how to map relational space. GIS emphasizes the absolute
space (inches, feet, miles) but can do little to represent how space was
constructed. But this way of thinking about space opens up new lines of inquiry
about the connections between culture and geography. Philip Ethington asks
scholars to think more broadly about definitions of space. In his example of Los
Angeles, the city can exist as the Consolidated Metropolitan Area of the US
Census Bureau, or the City of Los Angeles, or popular definitions of the city in
sources like <em>Baywatch</em> or <em>Blade Runner</em>. How do we reconcile the technology of
GIS with its emphasis on the given-ness of space with the constructed-ness of
space?</p>

<p>Especially significant in spatial humanities is the reliance on mapping not as
a byproduct of research, but integrated deeply throughout the research process.
Spatial humanities offers new ways to construct narratives about historical
events.</p>
